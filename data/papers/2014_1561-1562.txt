Undergraduate Attitudes Towards Help-SeekingIris Howley, Carolyn Penstein Rosé, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PAihowley@cs.cmu.edu, cprose@cs.cmu.eduIntroductionAppropriate help-seeking is a necessary skill in becoming a successful self-regulated learner (Newman, 1994),however many students under-use or abuse the help facilities offered to them by interactive learningenvironments (ILEs) (Koedinger & Aleven, 2007). A variety of dispositional factors affect student help-seekingpractices and social concerns are often under-explored in the context of individual ILEs. In our work, we focuson undergraduate students, because they may still struggle with social factors in their desire to build andmaintain a positive social identity in the new and sometimes intimidating university context. This paper presentsresults from a survey study that provides foundational insights into the factors affecting student help-seekingpractices in our target student population.Nelson-Le Gall (1981) proposes a model of help-seeking in classroom contexts in which the studentmust (1) first become aware of a help need, (2) decide to seek help from an external source, (3) identifypotential helpers, (4) implement strategies for engaging the helper, and (5) reflect upon the help-seekingattempt. Aleven et al (2003) adapt this model to ILEs, stopping short of examining the help-seeking process incollaborative ILEs. Of particular interest to our future work is step 2 (students’ decisions to seek help) and step4 (strategies for seeking help). We propose that student dispositions should impact whether and how studentsseek help, and explore this hypothesis in this survey.Our future work examines how manipulating public threats to self-esteem might interact with studentdispositions and private threats to self-esteem to affect their help-seeking. We will manipulate evaluationapprehension and public threats through a variety of means: social role of the tutor, social/technical presence ofthe tutor, relationship between the collaborators, and public/private help facilities. But first, we must understandif our potential students encounter difficulties seeking help, and if there are particular student dispositions orsocial situations that lend to more help-seeking.MethodParticipants include 26 participants (14 female, 12 male) with a mean age of 19.7 years (SD = 1.49) from auniversity in a small city, who completed a self-report questionnaire. In our questionnaire, the variables ofinterest include (1) student dispositions and (2) help-seeking strategies. Previous literature suggests thatdispositions, including shyness, personality, gender, self-esteem, and achievement goals might impact helpseeking. Our self-report questionnaire uses a Shyness scale (Cheek, 1983), the short version of the Big FivePersonality Index (Rammstedt & John, 2007) (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, acceptance, andneuroticism), the one item self-esteem scale (Robins et al, 2001), and Midgley et al’s (2000) PALS achievementgoal questionnaire (mastery-oriented, performance avoidance-oriented, and performance approach-oriented).Our help-seeking strategies outcome items come from Wolters et al (2003) and consist of measures forgeneral intention to seek needed help, general intention to avoid needed help, perceived costs of help-seeking,perceived benefits of help-seeking, instrumental (autonomous) help-seeking goals, expedient (executive) helpseeking goals, seeking help from formal sources (e.g., teachers), seeking help from informal sources (e.g.,peers), as well as perceived teacher support of questioning.Results and ConclusionsAs this is a questionnaire study, relationships between factors are correlational. One would generally predicthigher self-esteem, mastery-orientation, and extraversion to be correlated with higher self-reports of positivehelp-seeking and to see dispositions such as performance-approach to be related to more negative outcomessuch as expedient help-seeking. Basic statistical information on our items is included in Table 1, and we discusscorrelations of interest below.Personality indicators of openness as well as performance-approach achievement goals were notsignificantly related to any help-seeking attitudes. Also, attitudes toward seeking help from formal sources donot appear to be related to any measured dispositional attributes. We see that perceived costs and benefits ofhelp are rather similar, with the costs being slightly more apparent to students than benefits. Surprisingly,seeking help from informal sources was reported with low scores, but when we look at the correlational resultsin Table 2, we see that students low in self-efficacy reported a greater preference for seeking help from peers, aswell as students reporting low amounts of mastery-oriented goals and higher amounts of performanceavoidance.ICLS 2014 Proceedings1561© ISLSTable 1: Basic statistics on our help-seeking survey items.ItemIntention to Seek HelpIntention to Avoid HelpPerceived Costs of HelpPerceived Benefits of HelpInstrumental Help-SeekingExecutive Help-SeekingHelp from Formal SourcesHelp from Informal SourcesTeacher Support of QuestionExampleIf I needed help in this class I would ask someone for assistanceIf I didn’t understand something in this class, I would guess rather than asksomeone for assistanceGetting help in this class would be an admission that I am just not smartenough to do the work on my ownGetting help in this class would make me a better studentI would get help in this class to learn to solve problems…by myselfThe purpose of asking somebody for help in this class would be to succeedwithout having to work as hardIf I were to seek help in this class it would be from the teacherIf I were to seek help in this class, it would be from another studentThe instructor tells students to interrupt her whenever they have a questionM4.963.23SD0.900.934.220.923.954.444.491.200.530.684.712.604.31.251.160.70Our initial results show a spread of opinions about help-seeking. This suggests that some students dohave obstacles when seeking help, so interventions to reduce social apprehension may help reduce helpavoidance. Furthermore, we see some expected connections between our measures of student dispositions andhelp-seeking outcomes, especially self-esteem, extraversion, and mastery-orientation. Results showing thatmastery learning-oriented goals are negatively correlated with seeking help from informal sources areinteresting because that suggests that learning-oriented students prefer not to ask for help from their peers. Onepossible explanation for this is that perhaps these students do not think their peers can help them sufficiently.Overall, we see support for varying opinions about help-seeking, and mostly correlations between greaterconfidence and positive help-seeking beliefs. This suggests that it may be more difficult to find relationshipsbetween less beneficial dispositions and help-seeking beliefs which may add complexity to future interventions.Table 2: Correlations between help-seeking attitudes (rows) and dispositions (columns).SelfesteemSeek HelpAvoid HelpCostsBenefitsInstrumentalExecutiveFormal SrcInformal SrcTeacher Sprt.48**-.47**.57**.63**SelfefficacyShynessBFICons-.34*.35*BFIExtra0.48**-.34*BFINeur.37*Mastery-.56**-.44**.55**.61**-.53**BFIAccept.43**Perf-Av-.41**-.52**-.44**-.60**-.41**.47**.45**-.41**.50**-.64**.44**.41**ReferencesAleven, V., Stahl, E., Schworm, S., Fischer, F., & Wallace, R.
