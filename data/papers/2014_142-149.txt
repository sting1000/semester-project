Measuring Affective Experience in the Midst of STEM LearningJayson Nissen, Jonathan Shemwell, University of Maine, 120 Bennett Hall, Orono, ME 04469,Email: jayson.nissen@maine.edu, jonathan.shemwell@maine.eduAbstract: The Experience Sampling Method, an at-the-moment survey technique, was used tomeasure university students’ affective experiences within school and in their daily lives onfour variables: activation, self-efficacy, motivation, and stress. Affect was compared forschool vs. non-school, and within school, STEM coursework vs. non-STEM coursework.Within STEM, affect for a focal physics course was compared to affect for all other STEMcourses. School was experienced with higher stress, lower intrinsic motivation, and lower selfefficacy than non-school. STEM and non-STEM courses were not experienced differently, butthe physics course was experienced with higher stress and lower self-efficacy than otherSTEM courses. The results suggest that, broadly, university coursework may undermineintrinsic motivation and that the negative impact occurs in the midst of instruction. Moretentatively, the process of engaging with challenging STEM content, such as that of thephysics course, may tend to increase stress and undermine self-efficacy.IntroductionIncreasing the number and diversity of students who enter and remain in the STEM education pipeline is animportant goal in the United States and in many developed countries (National Commission on Mathematicsand Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000; Osborne & Dillon, 2008). Attainment of this goal willnaturally depend on positive learning outcomes for diverse students in K-16 STEM education. One importantand often overlooked class of outcome is positive affect toward STEM domains. Two examples of affect arefeelings of self-efficacy and motivation. Declining STEM enrollments and increasingly negative attitudestoward STEM suggest that positive affect is in short supply within STEM instruction (Osborne, Simon, &Collins, 2003; Semsar, Knight, Birol & Smith 2011). Understanding the nature and sources of affect within thecurrent STEM education system is therefore an important research goal.Most studies of affect in STEM education have utilized survey techniques in which students reporttheir general attitudes and beliefs for an overall experience, such as at the end of a course. Many studies haverelated affective variables measured by surveys to important outcomes such as achievement. For examplesurvey-based studies in STEM have measured the possible mediating effect on student achievement of selfefficacy (Lee, 2009; Marra and Bogue, 2009), interest (Koller, Baumert & Schnabel, 2001), and motivation(Singh, Granville & Dika, 2002; Mujtaba and Reiss, 2013). Mujtaba and Reiss (2013) analyzed student end ofcourse responses to a survey to show that the lower representation of women in physics was related todifferences between male and female secondary student’s affective experiences in physics. Lee (2009) usedsurvey responses to investigate the factorial relationship of three affective traits within math, self-concept, selfefficacy, and anxiety, and how their relationship to student achievement varied between countries. Luzzo,Hasper, Albert, Bibby and Martinelli (1999) used pre/post surveys to investigate the impact of a self-efficacyenhancing intervention on student’s math and science self-efficacy and career interests. In a mixed methodsapproach Girod, Rau and Shepige (2002) used both surveys and interview case studies to demonstrate thatelementary school students had a higher quality of experience in a course focused on aesthetic understanding asopposed to one focused on conceptual understanding.A challenge in studying the impact of instruction on affect is that it is difficult to measure affectiveresponse in the midst of the experience. Holleran, Whitehead, Schmader and Mehl (2010) used analysis ofrandom audio samples from day to day life to overcome this difficulty. They showed how stereotype threataffected how female STEM faculty interacted with other female faculty as opposed to male faculty. Stephens(2012) reproduced the classroom experience in the laboratory in order to measure stress caused by the mismatchbetween the culture of college and that of first generation students on students. Stephens measured stress byperiodically collecting saliva (for cortisol analysis) while students gave speeches they had written.Our approach to measuring affective response within instruction is to adapt a technique called theExperience Sampling Method (ESM) (Hektner, Schmidt & Csikszentmihalyi 2007). We used ESM to measureuniversity students’ affective experience in their courses and throughout their day-to-day lives on four distinctcategories of affective experience: activation, self-efficacy, motivation, and stress. This method allowedcomparing experience between the students’ school and non-school activities, and between their STEM andnon-STEM courses.ICLS 2014 Proceedings142© ISLSMethodsThe purpose of the study was to investigate students' experiences of self-efficacy, stress, motivation, andactivation in both non-school and school experiences, and within these school experiences to compare studentsexperience in both STEM and non-STEM courses. A further purpose was to compare affect within a focal,reformed STEM course to affect within other STEM courses.ContextThe study took place at a flagship state university in United States. The focal STEM course was a 15-weeklarge-enrollment calculus-based introductory physics course. The instructor, who had more than 20 years ofteaching experience, was on his fifth year of teaching the course. In the previous four years, the instructor hadimplemented several research based teaching practices that are commonly referred to as interactive engagement(IE) practices (Hake, 1998; Kost-Smith, 2011). These included collaborative problem solving activities in thetwo one-hour recitation periods each week, and electronic response, i.e. “clicker”, questions embeddedthroughout both one-hour weekly lectures. There was also one two-hour lab each week that was not taught byinteractive engagement. Data collected in this “IE Physics” course demonstrated learning outcomes that weresimilar or superior to those of IE courses at other institutions (Hake, 1998). Specifically, on Force and MotionConceptual Evaluation (Thornton & Sokoloff, 1998), the IE Physics course yielded normalized gains for theprevious four years ranging between 45% and 55%. Grade distributions in the course were approximatelyevenly distributed with 24% A’s, 23% B’s, 27% C’s and a 26% rate of drop, withdrawal, or failure (DWF). Areport obtained from the university’s Director of Institutional Research showed that the grading distribution wasnot different from those of other STEM courses.ParticipantsParticipants were 33 of the 244 students enrolled in the IE physics course. Half of the participants were female(17). This proportion over-represented the population of females in the course, which was 18%. Participantswere recruited by a brief presentation in the IE physics lecture and a follow-up email to those who providedtheir contact information. Participants had higher final grades than the average for students in the course, 82%versus 76%, but similar distributions in grades awarded. Participants were compensated with extra credit in theIE physics course for the first time they participated, and a check for 50 USD for the second time theyparticipated.DesignThe design was a within-subject comparison of the affective experience within school (i.e., while in class ordoing homework) and non-school activities spanning the range of students’ day-to-day lives. Experience withinschool was broken down according to three different types of courses participants were enrolled in: IE Physics,STEM courses other than IE Physics, and non-STEM courses.ProceduresData collection occurred during two separate weeklong periods during the third and tenth week of the semester.Twelve of the 33 participants provided ESM data during both data collections. During the data collection weeks,no tests were taken or returned in the IE physics course. Participants completed a one-hour training the weekprior to their first week of data collection. Training included a description of the ESM and practice doing theESM.During data collection participants in the ESM were semi-randomly signaled using a text message sentto their personal cell phone 5-8 times a day across each one-week period for a total of 50 signals for each week.Five of the signals were scheduled for random times during each of the scheduled IE physics course components(lab, lectures, and recitations) throughout the week. This allowed collecting a large enough number of surveys toprovide a representative and diverse sample of experience within the IE physics course setting. Participantsreceived the remaining 45 random text message signal during daily activities: making breakfast, driving, sittingin class, playing sports, etc.Upon receiving a signal, students would pause what they were doing to fill out very brief at-themoment survey about their affective experience. Sometimes the signal would occur during a university courseor an activity related to a course such as homework; sometimes it would occur during non-school recreationalhours or while students were involved in quotidian tasks such as laundry or dishes. Participants’ responsesbegan with writing brief statements about what they were doing, what they were thinking, and where they were.Participants would then check a circle for each of 20 Likert-scale affective questions to indicate their affectiveexperience in the activity. Example items drawn from the survey are provided in Figure 1 and described morefully in Table 1. A pilot study showed that completing the survey took 1-3 minutes. Most participants in thepilot study indicated it had little or no impact on their activity.ICLS 2014 Proceedings143© ISLSSome activities (such as driving), prevented participants from providing their responses at the momentof the signal. In accordance with standard ESM procedures, participants were told to complete surveys as soonas possible after the signal and to complete them regardless of how much time had passed. The survey formincluded a space to indicate the delay between the signal and completion of the survey. Only surveys completedwithin 15 minutes of the signal were included in the data analysis. This is a standard technique of ESM to helpensure that the responses measure affect as close to the moment of the signal as practicable. Similarly, onlyparticipants who completed at least fifteen surveys were included in the data analysis because that is broadlyconsidered to be a minimum threshold for measuring student’s average experience when using the ESM(Hektner et. al., 2007). The first author collected the surveys at the end of the data collection period andtranscribed the Likert-scale and open-ended responses into a data file containing all responses for each student.Figure 1: Examples of Likert-scale affective questions used in the ESM data collection.Construct Definitions and InstrumentationTable 1 defines each category of effective experience and shows several survey items used to measure it. Thesurvey items were drawn from prior research using ESM (Hektner et. al., 2007). As is done in many ESMstudies, item groupings were confirmed in the present study using exploratory factor analysis. As can be seenfrom Table 1, the measures within the ESM access each of the affective categories broadly and cannotdistinguish fine details within these constructs. For instance research on motivation includes concepts such asgoal orientation (Belenky and Nokes-Malach, 2012), which are not represented in the present study’sformulation. Similar examples of the complexity of the other affect categories defined in Table 1 existthroughout the scientific literature. The present study’s coarser measurements were a trade-off for the ability toaccess multiple categories of affective experience across daily activities for a representative sample ofparticipants.Self-efficacy was the primary category of interest in designing the research due its obviousimplications for attracting and retaining students in STEM. Bandura (1997) defined self-efficacy as theconfidence in one’s capability to perform the actions necessary to achieve a particular goal. The present studydeparted from Bandura in that it focused on self-efficacy experiences, as opposed to more stable dispositions orbeliefs, by asking how skilled or successful people felt in the activity they were doing (Table 1). However, thepresent study aligned with Bandura in that the measure was specific to the activity at hand. The self-efficacymeasure was based on items with unipolar scales, starting from a zero value and extending to a maximum.Intrinsic motivation was comprised of enjoyment, excitement, freedom (as opposed to constraint), andimportance to future goals. Several of the motivation items had bipolar scales, making the intrinsic motivationmeasurement either negative (extrinsic) or positive (intrinsic). Intrinsic motivation was measured on theassumption that it is necessary, at some level, for students to opt themselves into a learning experience.Additionally, Deci, Koestner & Ryan (1999) showed the importance of intrinsic motivation by demonstratingthe long-term negative impact of extrinsic motivation on persistence and learning.Stress and activation were utilized as complementary measures to further inform self-efficacy andmotivation. For instance, we wanted to see if feelings of low self-efficacy were generally accompanied bystress. Lazarus & Folkman (1984) defined stress as a negative feeling resulting from an individual’s perceptionthat they do not have the resources to cope with a perceived situation. Our measure was only loosely alignedwith this definition: we asked directly about stress, worry and frustration. All of the stress items utilizedunipolar scales. Activation was defined as the level of involvement in the task, consistent with Thayer (1996). Incontrast to Thayer’s formulation activation was a unipolar measure, which included alertness, attentiveness, andthe degree to which the participant was concentrating on the activity.ICLS 2014 Proceedings144© ISLSTable 1: Details for each of the affective categories measured by the ESMAffectCategoryNumberof itemsExample questionsDefinitionActivation7How alert did you feel?

School activities were then reduced to three approximately equal sized categories: (1) NonSTEM courses which included a diverse range of courses such as English, anthropology, and art; (2) STEMcourses excluding IE physics, primarily consisted of chemistry, calculus and introductory engineering courses;and (3) IE physics. Analysis of variance showed that, within both the STEM and non-STEM categories, therewere no statistically significant differences in affective responses between courses composing both categories,i.e. calculus and chemistry (p >0.20).For an activity type, each participant’s set of responses to each of the Likert-scale affect questions wasconverted to Z-scores based on the mean and standard deviation of the participants’ responses to that question.A Z-score is calculated for any score by subtracting from it the mean for the set of scores from which it is drawn,then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the set. Calculating Z-scores is a standard ESM procedurethat allows comparing responses between students who use the Likert-scale differently. Essentially eachperson’s score for a question is scaled in relation to their own average response for that question. Exploratoryfactor analysis on the responses confirmed that individual items grouped into four factors corresponding to thefour constructs the survey was designed to measure: activation, self-efficacy, stress, and motivation. Thesecategories of affect were calculated by averaging the Z-scores for each item within the construct.ResultsDifferences in mean Z-scores were tested with two multivariate analysis of variance tests (MANOVA). The firsttest used two independent variables (non-school and school), and four dependent variables (activation, selfefficacy, motivation, and stress). It showed a statistically significant effect of activity type F(4,1440) = 334.0, p< 0.001. Subsequent one-way ANOVA tests contrasted activity type for each affect variable. They showed thatthere were statistically significant differences in mean Z-scores for school and non-school activities for all fourvariables, activation F(1,1440) = 13.1, p < 0.001, self-efficacy F(1,1440) = 387.8, p < 0.001, stress F(1,1440) =130.2, p < 0.001 and intrinsic motivation F(1,1440) = 1019.4, p < 0.001. The second MANOVA used the samedependent variables but separated the school independent variable into non-STEM courses, STEM courses andIE physics. Non-school activities comprised the fourth independent variable. The MANOVA showed astatistically significant effect of activity type F(12,1440) = 75.5, p < 0.001. Subsequent one-way ANOVAscomparing the four activity types for each affect variable showed that all four affect variables had at least onestatistically significant difference in mean Z-scores, activation F(3,1440) = 9.15, p < 0.001, self-efficacyF(3,1440) = 140.5, p < 0.001, stress F(3,1440) = 57.8, p < 0.001 and intrinsic motivation F(3,1440) = 341.2, p <0.001. Post-hoc analysis was conducted using Tukey’s HSD.Results of the ESM measurements are summarized in Figure 2. Table 2 shows statistically significantdifferences and effect sizes in Z-score units. Both representations show that school and non-school activitieswere experienced very differently. School, compared to non-school, produced slightly more activation, muchICLS 2014 Proceedings145© ISLSlower self-efficacy, much higher stress, and much lower intrinsic motivation (i.e., more extrinsic motivation).Within school, STEM courses were experienced with slightly more activation and slightly more self-efficacythan non-STEM, but these differences were not statistically significant. IE physics was experienced, ascompared to other STEM courses, with similar activation, but lower self-efficacy and higher stress. Intrinsicmotivation was not different across school categories.Figure 2.

For example, the large negative Z-score for intrinsicmotivation in school does not necessarily mean that intrinsic motivation was actually negative in school. Rather,students may have had a slightly positive intrinsic motivation in school that was nevertheless lower than a largerpositive value for non-school experiences. For this reason, we examined the raw values for each of the affectcategories to better interpret students’ affective states within activity types. The following analysis is presentedfor motivation. A similar analysis was done for each of the other variables to ensure that the Z-score values inFigure 2 and Table 2 did not misrepresent students’ affective states.Intrinsic motivation was constructed from four questions on the ESM. Two of the questions, “Did youenjoy what you were doing?” and “How important was this activity to your future goals?” were measured onfive-point unipolar scales. The other two questions, “How free or constrained did you feel?” and “How excitedor bored did you feel?”, were measured on seven-point bi-polar scales. The distributions of student responses onthese four questions in school and non-school activities are shown in Figure 3. They show that intrinsicmotivation in school was negative. School experiences tended to not be very enjoyable, and they were oftenICLS 2014 Proceedings146© ISLSboring or unexciting. Feelings of freedom or constraint were more mixed but trended toward constraint. Finally,school activities were important to students’ future goals. All of these results were in opposition to experiencesoutside of school, which tended to be enjoyable, free, and exciting while being less important to students’ futuregoals. Based on these results, we concluded that the negative Z-score for students’ experiences of intrinsicmotivation in school activities was representative of motivation that was extrinsic, compared to intrinsic nonschool motivation.Figure 3: Distributions of student experience across the questions that made up intrinsic motivation.DiscussionComparing results for school and non-school, the differences in affect were consistent with the pressures thatuniversity students would be expected to feel as they strive to learn and generally perform well as novices in acompetitive, (i.e., graded), environment. From this perspective, the lower self-efficacy and higher stress ofschool activities compared to non-school at least make sense. However, it is difficult to interpret the values ofself-efficacy and stress for school activities. Perhaps these values could be improved; or perhaps they are anatural and healthy part of a student’s struggle to learn. By contrast, the negative experience of intrinsicmotivation in school activities (i.e., extrinsic motivation) is more clearly a cause for concern. Of course,extrinsic motivation is commensurate with the compulsory nature of many coursework activities such asstudying for tests and completing problem sets. Educational systems generally tend to rely on structures andprocedures, such as performance-contingent rewards, known to negatively impact intrinsic motivation (e.g.,Deci, Koestner & Ryan, 1997). While the motivation results are not surprising, they are nevertheless worthpaying attention to, since any educational program ultimately depends on students’ self-regulated attempts tolearn from what they are doing (Brophy, 2010). What the results of the present study show, compared to moretheory-driven studies in the mold of Deci Deci, Koestner & Ryan (1997), is that negative intrinsic motivation isa measureable response to the education system, and not only a probable response based on the system’s design.This “direct” measure of motivation has the potential to more squarely confront administrators, instructors, andother stakeholders with the consequences of motivation-reducing structures and procedures.The IE physics course had higher stress and lower self-efficacy compared to other STEM courses,despite similar levels of activation (i.e., attentiveness, alertness, and concentration). These results could havebeen due to idiosyncrasies of the instructor. However the instructor’s relatively long experience teaching thecourse, high average achievement, and distribution of grades similar to those of other STEM courses allundermine this possibility. We think it more probable that students’ affect resulted from the experience of afairly rigorous STEM course focused on learning conceptually challenging STEM content. If so, the presentstudy would confirm the results of studies utilizing pre-post survey measures showing negative impacts of IEphysics on self-efficacy (Kost-Smith, 2011). In the case of the present study, however, the negative impact of IEPhysics was shown to occur within instructional activities, instead of upon reflection after the fact. This findingrules out the possibility that the negative impacts of self-efficacy measured by Kost-Smith may have occurredICLS 2014 Proceedings147© ISLSprimarily as a result of experiences outside instruction, such as when students received their grades. Rather, anegative effect on self-efficacy was located unequivocally within the process of instruction.The lower self-efficacy for IE Physics might seem be inconsistent with the relatively high achievementin the course compared to other IE courses, since high achievement would be expected to encompass masteryexperiences promoting self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). However, while students in an IE course may learn morethan they would in a traditional, lecture-based course (Hake, 1998), they are probably still far from mastery,which takes much longer to achieve than the brief experience of a semester-long course would allow (Chi,Feltovitch, & Glaser, 1981; diSessa, 2006; Ohlsson, 2009). Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that moststudents in a course would not be able to achieve anything near the levels of mastery that would lead toincreasing in self-efficacy, even if they were learning at optimal levels. For this reason, it may be that educatorsshould expect effective learning of challenging STEM content to be decoupled from self-efficacy on the timeframe of one or two semesters during which most students experience this content. In essence, while studentsknowledge and skills are growing in the course, their awareness of what they don’t yet understand and can’t yetdo are growing faster.The present study has taken steps toward better understanding what is arguably a crucial and too longneglected aspect of STEM teaching and learning, affective experiences within instruction. The most importantcontribution of the study has been to measure the affective response in the midst of the instructional process.The results of this measurement, should they be replicated and extended in future studies, have the potential toraise the awareness of affective response to the process of instruction, and to motivate and inform the search forbetter instructional methods.ReferencesAdams, W., Perkins, K., Podolefsky, N., Dubson, M., Finkelstein, N., & Wieman, C.
