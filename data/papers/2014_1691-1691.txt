Using aparticipatory problem-solving framework, the goal of Moocshop 2014 is to collaborativelygenerate priorities for platform development, instructional strategies, and research in MOOCs,with a clear emphasis on learning. The facilitators and presenters will lead a set of activitiesand discussions around integrating insights from the learning sciences into the design ofMOOCs, as well as how MOOCs provide opportunities for the learning sciences as a site forresearch.ICLS 2014 Proceedings1691Â© ISLS
