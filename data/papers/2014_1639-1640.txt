The method is inspired by Systemic Functional Linguisticsystem of ‘Transitivity’. Findings revealed significant differences between two instructors'mathematical talk in a teachers’ college course. These differences were mainly seen in theamount of ‘objectified’ vs. ‘personified’ talk of each of the instructors.IntroductionMethods for analyzing classroom discourse have proliferated in recent years together with the surge of interestin promoting ‘discourse rich’ instruction (Mercer, 2010). And yet, these methods are mainly concerned withwhat may be termed the ‘social’ rather than disciplinary aspects of talk. As useful as these methods are, theyhave difficulty in capturing aspects of the content of talk rooted in disciplinary practices. As such, importantaspects of talk such as the level of abstractness or conceptual depth of the talk have not received as muchattention as needed.We suggest a new method for quantitative analysis of mathematical talk which is based on a‘communicational’ framework for analyzing mathematical discourse (Sfard, 2008). Sfard conceptualizesmathematical learning as change in participation in a certain type of discourse. She distinguishes between‘objectified’ talk and ‘syntactic talk’ which treats the mathematical signs without relating to the objects that aresignified by them. Most often, this syntactic talk is accompanied by personified talk where the student talksabout what they do to the mathematical signifiers, how they move them around, etc. The difference betweenpersonified talk and objectified talk has been captured by many others as the difference between “procedural” or“calculational” vs. “conceptual” talk (Rittle-Johnson & Alibali, 1999). Our goal in this work was to come upwith a ‘coding and counting’ method that would capture quantitatively the difference between personified andobjectified talk.MethodologyThe data was taken from a larger project that aims at making explicit teaching and learning processes ofprospective elementary school mathematics teachers in a college for education in Israel. For this purpose twosimilar courses were video-taped and fully transcribed. For the current analysis, two segments, similar in theirmathematical content, were taken from the 6th and 7th lesson of each course (out of 14 lessons, 90 min. long).The ‘objectified’ vs. ‘personified’ distinction was captured by SFL’s system of ‘Transitivity’ (Eggins,2004, p. 207). Three types of categories were found to be most relevant: (a) Material: clauses that include anActor and a Goal. We distinguished between material processes in which the Actor is human (ex. You multipliedthe two numbers) from processes where the Actor is the mathematical object itself (ex. the x moves up by 1).The objectified quality of talk has been associated by Sfard (2008) with ‘being’ verbs. According to SFL, thereare two main types of being processes: Existential processes, where things are simply stated to exist; andRelational processes, where things are stated to exist in relation to other things (are assigned attributes oridentities). Thus, our next two categories are: (b) Existential processes that posit that ‘there was/is something’(ex. ‘There is a linear function’). (c) Relational processes include (c1) Intensive attributive processes, in whichan attribute is assigned to a participant (ex. ‘The slope is steeper’) and (c2) Intensive identifying processes,which are about defining (ex. ‘Intercept equals negative five’).When looked at from a mathematical-communicational perspective, intensive:identifying,intensive:attributive and existential clauses may be indicators of a general ‘objectified’ quality of the talk, solong as the subject of the clause (Token or Carrier) are mathematical objects. In contrast, process:materialclauses may indicate personified talk, so long as they include a human agent as the Actor of the clause.We checked the reliability of our coding in three phases. After resolving disagreements, an agreed upon‘clean’ version of the clause segmentation was prepared for further coding. The three phases were: 1. Reliabilityof clause segmentation (85% agreement). 2. Reliability of selection-for-coding: 89% (Kappa 0.76). 3. Reliabilityof clause-codes (according to the 5 categories described above) 100% (Kappa:1.0 ).FindingsFindings pointed to significant differences in the two instructors’ talk. Whereas Instructor 1 talked aboutICLS 2014 Proceedings1639© ISLSmathematical objects mostly in a personified way (24%) or by giving the mathematical objects some agency(41%), Instructor 2 used mostly Intensive Identifying and Intensive attributive clauses. Thus 72% of instructor2clauses could be considered as ‘objectified’ while only 35% of instructor1 clauses could be considered as such.A chi-test revealed this difference to be highly significant (p<0.001).Following is a very short example of the two instructors’ talk that we coded and compared. Bothexcerpts deal with the definition of ‘slope’ of a linear function.SpkrInst.1What is said (clauses delineated by [a],[b], etc.)[a] ‘cause what is slope? [b] Again, what is slope? [c] How do you say that [d]this equals three? (points to the segment where the slope is 3) [e] For one unit [f]that we move on the x axis, [g] by how much did the y value increase? For thesame unit.Coding[a]II [b]II [c]HP[d]II[f]HP[g]OPIn contrast, Instructor 2’s definition of ‘slope’ was very different:Inst.2Inst.2[a] To determine, to determine whether [b] the slope is bigger or smaller, [c][a]HPthen it is possible to look at the angle between the x-axis, [d] or some line[b]IA [c,d,e,f,i]HPparallel to the x-axis, ok? [e] And each of those graphs. [f] And it is possible to [j,k] IAlook at, [g] as we spoke last time, [f]the size of the step. [h]Now, note that [i]todetermine [j] bigger or smaller [k] both ways are fine.A discussion revolves around what “a step” is after which Inst. 2 summarizes her definition of slope:[a] The height of the step when [b] the step's width is one unit. [c] That is, it is[a]II [b]II [c]IIthe change in the function's value when [d] the x value changes by one unit.[d]OPThe qualitative analysis of the episodes from which these excerpts were taken revealed that throughtheir talk, the two instructors made different realizations of the concept of slope available for their students.While instructor1 directed her students to realize “slope” only as a result of one type of routine (counting thedifference in y values over one step of x), instructor2 elicited several different routines and thus made differentrealizations of slope (as an angle; as a “step” or quotient of dy and dx) available to her students. We believe thequantitative analysis partially captured this qualitative difference by showing that instructor 2’s talk was muchmore objectified than that of instructor 1.Discussion and ConclusionsWe believe that the presented method, and especially its application together with qualitative methods ofanalysis, holds much promise. In recent decades, significant advancements have been made in understandingprocesses of teaching and learning mathematics via employing methods of discourse analysis (Ryve, 2011). Yetthe potential of the findings from these studies to be generalized has been seriously limited by the qualitativeand episodic nature of these methods. The present method is intended to extend the power of discourseanalytical methods, and in particular, Sfard’s (2008) communicational framework, to enable comparisonbetween teachers, classrooms and students. Such comparisons should provide us, in the future, with means toaddress important questions such as the relationship between the quality of teachers’ talk and students’achievements.ReferencesEggins, S.
