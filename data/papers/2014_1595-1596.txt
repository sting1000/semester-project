Beyond ‘Solve for x’:Integrating Equations with Conceptual UnderstandingMatthew Lira, University of Illinois at Chicago, mlira2@uic.eduAbstract: This research attempts to describe how biology students’ integrate equations withdisciplinary concepts. First, I assess how students’ explanations of biological phenomenachange after solving word problems and receiving feedback from a quantitative simulation.Then, I describe a novel learning environment for further exploring design principles thatsupport students in integrating equations with conceptual knowledge. With biology careersincreasingly demanding mathematical approaches, students are better prepared to enter thesecareers if they can integrate equations with conceptual knowledge.IntroductionHistorically, scientists have touted mathematics as the language of nature. Modern Learning Sciencesperspectives adopt a less romantic approach by arguing that mathematics supports communication (Lemke,2003) and cognition (Schwartz & Moore, 1998). Science students who receive instruction with mathematics,however, often fail to integrate equations and algorithms with conceptual knowledge. The present research aimsto assess how science students’ explanations of phenomena change after solving word problems and receivingfeedback from a quantitative simulation. The research further aims to identify design principles that supportlearning with mathematics in science. Integrating mathematical representation and procedure with conceptualknowledge better prepares students for research careers and collaborations across STEM disciplines.Equations in Science EducationRegarding instruction, physics and chemistry educators traditionally teach science with equations and assessstudents’ understandings by posing word problems. Educational research in these disciplines demonstrates thatstudents struggle to integrate equations and algorithms with conceptual understandings of science content (e.g.Nakhleh, 1993). When educators attempt to relieve difficulty, improve performance, or teach non-sciencemajors, they often shift to a conceptual approach that eliminates equations from instruction. Treatingmathematical and conceptual approaches as separate, however, reflects a false dichotomy. The present researchaims to improve our knowledge of how students integrate equations with disciplinary concepts when learningwith technologies designed to foster integration.The Knowledge in Pieces ApproachThe KiP framework offers a systematic approach to analyzing how students’ organize knowledge elements visà-vis equations. KiP refers to the fragmented bits of knowledge that students coordinate to complete disciplinarytasks (diSessa, 1993). The KiP approach maintains that students’ knowledge elements exists as a system thatresides in a state of flux as opposed to a coherent structure organized around stable theories and beliefs.The KiP framework was applied previously to characterize how students understand physics equations(Sherin, 2001). By Sherin’s analysis, students understand physics equations by using the knowledge elementssymbolic forms. All forms consist of a symbolic template and a conceptual schema. The template denotes theabstract structure that students recognize in an equation and the schema denotes the general idea that thetemplate represents. Students interpret equations by recognizing their abstract structure. For instance, uponrecognizing a term as a coefficient, students explain that the coefficient “just tunes” the size of an effect. Thepresent research aims to (1) explore the generativity of Sherin’s framework by extending it from physics tobiology education and (2) identify domain-specific design principles that support biology students in integratingequations with conceptual knowledge.MethodsStudents (n = 10; M = 20 years; Range = 20-23) were concurrently enrolled in a (200-level) biology coursetitled Homeostasis. Students participated in semi-structured interviews that asked them to answer the question,“How does a cell generate a resting membrane potential?” Then, students were randomly assigned to eithersolve word problems with a quantitative simulation that mathematically models how cells generate restingmembrane potentials or, for comparison, to observe a narrated animation that explained this process. Afterreceiving instruction, students answered the question once more. Students’ explanations were video and audiorecorded for later transcription and analysis. Data were collected in a laboratory setting.Regarding the domain under consideration, biological cells possess the capacity to generate transmembrane voltages. If an ionic species is more concentrated in the intracellular fluid than in the extracellularfluid, then the species will tend to diffuse down the chemical gradient due to random motions. Because cellsICLS 2014 Proceedings1595© ISLSpossess ion-selective protein channels, some ions will diffuse down their gradient, carrying their charge withthem. This causes oppositely charged particles to separate at the membrane. The value at which the electricaldriving forces balance the chemical driving forces is the cell’s resting membrane potential or steady statevoltage. We can model this system mathematically with the Nernst and Goldman equations (see Equation 1).𝐺!𝑋!𝐺!𝐺!   2   𝑉! =∙ 𝐸! +∙ 𝐸!   +∙𝐸 …𝑋!𝐺!𝐺! !  𝐺!Equation 1. (1) Nernst potential.

Competitionrefers to two or more influences that vie in a struggle to produce some final effect. Within this cluster, studentsdraw heavily upon the symbolic form balance. Sherin (2001) describes balance as “two influences, eachassociated with a side of the equation, in balance so that the system is in equilibrium” (pg. 533). Similarly,diSessa’s (1993) describes the knowledge element dynamic balance as “a pair of forces or directed influencesthat are in conflict and happen to balance each other” (pg. 222). For instance, one student stated, “So there hasto be an equal amount of charge, not an equal amount of charge but it’s kind of like two opposing forces. Likethe concentration and also the charge.”Whereas instruction with a quantitative simulation promoted students to shift to cuing the equilibrium(stability within parameters) and equilibration (return to stability) knowledge elements, instruction with anarrated animation promoted students to shift to the balance element. For instance, after solving word problemswith the simulation, one student stated, “When things get out of whack […] the cell wants to get things back toits composition of the way that it works most efficiently. So it’s going to either take the ions out of the cell ortake the ions from the outside of the cell and bring them in to reach equilibrium.” Thus, she cues theequilibration element. In contrast, a student who experienced the animation stated, “There comes a point wherethey reach a balance, where the diffusion force will equal the electric force.” Thus, he cues the balance element.Conclusions and Future DirectionsThe KiP framework holds promise for knowledge analysis in biology. The initial phase of the investigationsuggests that learning with equations can shift the cuing priority of knowledge elements differently thanlearning without equations. Unfortunately, these results suggest that learning with equations in the absence ofexplicit instructional support fails to shift students towards productive mechanistic reasoning compared tolearning with a narrated animation. This marks the first step towards the next phase of the investigation wherethe goal will be to design a learning environment that helps students better integrate equations with disciplinaryconcepts. Specifically, the design will aim to leverage the affordances of both the quantitative simulation andthe narrated animation. The potential design solution aims to foster reflection and the integration of knowledgeby providing students the opportunity to relate the two instructional media to each other and to their ownunderstanding. The design aims to accomplish these ends by promoting students to generate representations oftheir knowledge while learning with equations.ReferencesdiSessa, A. (1993).
