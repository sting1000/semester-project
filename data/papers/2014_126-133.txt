Promoting 5th Graders’ Views of Science and Scientific Inquiry in anEpistemic-Enriched Knowledge-Building EnvironmentFeng Lin, Carol K.K. Chan, Jan van Aalst, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong KongEmail: irisfeng83@gmail.com; ckkchan@hku.hk; vanaalst@hku.hkAbstract: This paper reports on an ongoing study that examined the design of aknowledge-building environment that integrates knowledge building and epistemic changetheories in fostering conceptual and epistemic growth. The study uses a quasi-experimentaldesign in which four classes of 5th graders in Hong Kong participated in a unit focusing onelectricity. The intervention involved students' collective inquiry and, epistemic reflection onwhat science is about; students used Knowledge Forum® to collaboratively work on pursuingideas; and students reflected on scientific progress with their own knowledge building inquiry.A scheme was developed in assessing students' views of science; and results showedsignificantly stronger effects for the knowledge-building group compared with the regularinquiry group on epistemic and conceptual learning. Regression analysis showed thatstudents’ forum engagement and epistemic views contributed to their posttest conceptualunderstanding over and above prior science knowledge. Qualitative analysis suggested howstudents’ experience in knowledge building might shape students’ understanding about thenature of science and improve their conceptual understanding.Epistemic cognition, or thinking about the nature of knowledge and knowing, has received much researchattention in recent decades. Substantial evidence has shown that sophisticated personal epistemologies areimportant predictors of learning, including learning strategies and processes and conceptual change (Hofer &Pintrinch, 2002). Of particular interest about students’ views of knowledge and knowing relates to what theythink about the nature of science and how scientific knowledge is created. Although there is widespreadrecognition of the importance of scientific inquiry, often students do not think of science as an epistemicidea-driven and theory-building process. Rather children tend to think of science as concrete activities, andscientific inquiry as acquiring sets of skills such as the methodical collection of data and testing of variables(Chinn & Malhotra, 2002). The purpose of this study is to investigate students’ epistemic understanding ofscience as a theory-building process in the context of their working on knowledge building inquiry supported byKnowledge Forum®, a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. Specifically, the goal is todesign and examine a learning environment to foster students’ epistemic and conceptual growth via linkingviews of science with knowledge building inquiry, and also to investigate the intertwined relationship betweenthe designed environment, epistemic cognitions and conceptual understanding.Theoretical PerspectivesEpistemic Cognition and Views of ScienceThere are different research traditions that examine what people think about the nature of knowledge and natureof science. Some extended the psychometric tradition initiated by Schommer (1990) and Hofer & Pintrich(1997) and took a multidimensional approach to examine epistemic beliefs; examples of the examineddimensions included certainty of knowledge, source of knowledge, justification for knowing, and developmentof knowledge (Conley et al., 2004). Another major approach developed from research in science education. Forexample, Lederman and colleagues (2002) examined several aspects of the nature of science (NOS), such as theempirical nature of science, tentative nature of science, creative and imaginative nature of science, andinferential nature of science, and so on. A third tradition examines students’ epistemology of science from the“role of idea” perspective. Herein, science is perceived as a theory building process and the construction ofever-deeper explanations of the natural world (Carey et al., 1989; Chuy, et al., 2010). Carey et al. (1989)developed a clinical interview protocol and identified three general levels of understanding about science amongmiddle school students, ranging from seeing science as discovering facts and making inventions, to seeing it asconstructing explanations for phenomena. Later Smith et al. (2000) extended this line of research and elaboratedscience as theory building, and Chuy et al. (2010) further developed the interview protocol to examinechildren’s understanding of science in relation to knowledge building. This study follows this tradition (Bereiteret al., 1996) and examines students’ understanding of science as an idea-driven and theory-building process. Wechoose to build on this line of research mainly for two reasons: (1) science as a theory-building process (Kuhn,1970) is important but often overlooked and portrayed merely a process of observation and experimentation inschool science (Carey & Smith, 1993); (2) how students understand the theoretical progress of science may befacilitated as they build knowledge together; and such research direction may help develop new instruments andICLS 2014 Proceedings126© ISLSextend our understanding of epistemology in relation to community process. We use the term epistemiccognition to refer to a broad notion that encompasses both cognitions of the nature of knowledge (Hofer &Pintrich, 2002) and nature of science (Lederman et al., 2002).Research has shown that epistemic cognition influences students’ conceptual change (Mason, 2000;Qian & Alvermann, 1995), for example, epistemic cognition may affect learners’ intention to restructureknowledge (Vosniadou & Brewer, 1987). However, many previous studies conceptualize the relationshipbetween epistemic cognitions, thinking and learning within theories of knowledge construction withinindividual learners. As learning theories have shifted from individual to collective, knowledge construction is nolonger perceived as an individual but a social process (Brown et al., 1989). There is a need to extendinvestigation of epistemic cognition of scientific process to socio-cognitive processes and to examine how itmay influence cognition in social context. As well, scientific progress and theory building evolves in scientificcommunities via collective advances, not only individual endeavors. Thus far, there are few investigationslooking into the social and collaborative aspects of epistemic cognition. This study will examine students’ viewsof science as a social-cognitive and community process, and investigate how these views relate to students’knowledge building and conceptual understanding.Computer Supported Knowledge Building, Reflection, and Epistemic ChangeKnowledge building is an educational model that has attracted much research attention in learning sciences andCSCL (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). Its role in student learning and cognition has been discussed in agrowing number of studies (e.g., Lee et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; van Aalst & Chan, 2007). Knowledgebuilding emphasizes on students, similar to scientists, working as a community and taking collective cognitiveresponsibility for idea improvement (Scardamalia, 2002). In knowledge building, students’ collaborativediscourse is supported by a computer supported collaborative learning platform, Knowledge Forum®(KF), inwhich students pose questions, make conjectures, co-construct explanations, reorganize ideas, and revise andintegrate ideas. To make knowledge building more explicit, knowledge building principles (Scardamalia, 2002)have been proposed to guide students and teachers’ knowledge building practice. These principles provideepistemological scaffolds for students’ knowledge work in their community (usually their class), as studentswork with the principles, that might help them move from naive epistemology to more sophisticated one.Primarily, “Knowledge building is not just a pedagogical approach but a theory of epistemology" (Bereiter,2002). The knowledge building principles, e.g., improvable ideas; rise above; constructive use of authoritativesources, and their technological function on Knowledge Forum, that is, making ideas explicit and as subject forbuilding on and revision, have important epistemic indications for students.The influence of knowledge building and metacognitive reflection on students’ conceptualunderstanding has been examined (van Aalst & Chan, 2007), and the important relations have been identifiedamong epistemic cognition, knowledge building, and conceptual understanding (Chan & Lam, 2010). Researchon science and epistemic inquiry has examined the roles of scaffolding epistemic standards and scientificpractice (Sandoval et al., 2005), however, fewer studies have attempted to design epistemic-enrichedknowledge-building environments helping students to reflect on their knowledge building practice that mirrorsthe theory-building nature of science. Research has indicated (Carey et al., 1989) that if students are tounderstand the role of theory in science, they need to be engaged actively in the explanation-basedtheory-building process and make metacognitive reflections about the process. As knowledge-building modelemphasizes idea improvement and collective advances, it provides a rich environment to understand and tofoster students’ understanding of the nature of science from the perspective of theory building. Accordingly, weaimed to design a knowledge building environment, emphasizing the theme of students working as communitiesand focusing on epistemic standards and the practice of scientists. A key idea is that when students working onideas in knowledge building, they are better able to experience the role of idea and theory building in science,which would in turn foster their epistemic views and conceptual understanding.To iterate, this study aimed to design an epistemic-enriched knowledge-building environment to fostermore sophisticated epistemic cognitions and conceptual understanding among students. Three researchquestions were addressed: (1) Do students engaging in epistemic enriched knowledge building achieve moreepistemic and conceptual growth than students in a regular inquiry-based learning environment? (2) What arethe relationships among knowledge building, reflection, epistemic cognition, and conceptual understanding? (3)How do the designed environment help students improve their epistemic cognition and conceptualunderstanding? This paper reports preliminary findings for these questions.MethodsParticipants and Procedure102 5th graders (age ranging 10-11) in four science classes in Hong Kong participated in this study. Theexperimental group included two classes, Class 1 (n=33) and Class 2 (n=19), engaging in computer-supportedICLS 2014 Proceedings127© ISLSknowledge-building inquiry with epistemic reflection. The comparison group also included two classes, Class 3(n=26) and Class 4 (n=24), taught with regular inquiry-based approach with metacognitive reflection. Theexperimental classes were selected according to teachers’ knowledge building experience, as two teachers(Class 1 & Class 2) have used knowledge building pedagogy for 4 years, and the other two (Class 3 & Class 4)are familiar with general inquiry-based approach. The study was conducted in six sessions lasting for aboutthree weeks. All four classes worked on an extended topic from their textbook study of electricity. These fourclasses have similar access to learning resources (video, experiment equipment, reading material) except that theexperimental classes used knowledge-building design that involved Knowledge Forum and epistemic reflection.Designing a Knowledge Building Environment for Epistemic and Conceptual ChangeThe experimental environment was designed based on an integration of knowledge building pedagogy (Chan,2011) and epistemic change theory (Bendixen, 2002). Primarily we engage students in a knowledge-buildingenvironment to pose problems, questions and explanations, and to make their ideas improvable, and to advancecommunity knowledge as in scientific communities. We also adapted epistemic change model that emphasizesepistemic doubt and resolution of doubts, enriched in a community of knowledge builders. Students work oncollective inquiry as communities of little scientists. The specific design principles are described below:(1) Articulate and activate prior understanding. Before engaging in inquiry, students were asked towrite down what science is about as well as their understanding about electricity, so that their ideas can be madevisible in the class and open for revision. This was designed not only for creating a knowledge building culturewhere ideas can be examined, but also for promoting students’ epistemic awareness and triggering theirepistemic doubt by learning about their peer’s different epistemic theories.(2) Start inquiry with authentic problems. We first provided students with everyday situation (video onlemon juice and salt water conducting electricity), to stimulate their wonderment about conductors. Then theywrote out their questions and ideas on Knowledge Forum based on this material. Students also worked togetherin groups to test out the conductivity of different materials. Inquiry-based activity and Knowledge Forum wereintertwined: students continually worked on Knowledge Forum after the experiment. Scaffolds were providedon Knowledge Forum to help them build and revise theories and explanations: “I need to understand”, “mytheory (explanation)”, “new information”, “a better theory (explanation)”, “your theory cannot explain”.(3) Deepen inquiry through knowledge building talk and experiment. In order to facilitate goodknowledge building discourse and engage them in deep construction of knowledge, knowledge-buildingprinciples (e.g., improvable ideas, epistemic agency) were explicitly discussed in the class, and linked toscientific process and scientific community. To test the ideas discussed on Knowledge Forum, students workedin groups to design experiments and make posters. Scaffolds were provided to facilitate this collective inquiryprocess: “our question”, “our theory”, “our hypothesis”, and “our experiment design”. After testing their ideas,students continued to write on Knowledge Forum to revise their theories. Meta-views were also created toencourage students to rise-above their existing theories.(4) Trigger and resolve epistemic doubt through collective epistemic talk. Classroom discourse wasconducted to scaffold students toward viewing scientific inquiry as a theory-building and theory-revisionprocess. The teachers triggered conceptual and epistemic doubts and engaged students to reflect on theexperiments and evidence; students were encouraged to think like scientists as they pursued inquiry andconsidered the need for revising their hypotheses and theory. Online and offline discourse was linked: Studentsdiscussed ‘electricity’ in one view alongside another ‘view’ that asked them to reflect on how scientistsconstruct knowledge, and how their work might be similar to scientists.(5) Understanding science as theory-building through collective epistemic reflection. Knowledgebuilding emphasizes collective inquiry and aims to help students to understand the social and collective natureof science. Students therefore were asked to reflect on their own scientific and knowledge building inquiryprocess as “little scientists.” Experts’ inquiry process and epistemic theories were illustrated on a worksheetpertaining to four different models of scientists, and students were asked to reflect and identify the part that theythink they have experienced. This was a scaffold designed to help students connect what they do and whatscientists do. Teachers then promoted a discussion among students to investigate the similarities between theirown collective inquiry process and the social construction process in scientific community.The comparison classes went through similar processes as the experimental classes. They first wrotetheir prior conceptions about electricity and nature of science, and watched the same video to start inquiry. Theydid the same experiments on conductors, and worked in groups to design experiments to test their own ideas.The scaffolds provided in the group inquiry were same as the experimental group. The only major difference isthat the experimental group used Knowledge Forum for inquiry, and had epistemic talk and reflection. To makethe comparison more equivalent, the comparison group students were asked to write reflection journals onpapers after class, and were provided with metacognitive scaffold, such as “my new learning”.ICLS 2014 Proceedings128© ISLSMeasuresWritten Questions on Epistemic Views of ScienceAll children were administered the written questionnaires at the beginning and end of the unit. Children’sepistemic views of science were measured with 8 written questions developed in this study based on Carey et al.(1989), Smith et al. (2000), Chuy et al. (2010), and Lederman & Ko’s (2004) items. Premised on the frameworkof science as theory building, four components were identified: (1) Role of idea (2) Theory building and theoryrevision (3) Theory-fact understanding; and (4) Social process of scientific progress. Examples of the questionsincluded: “What is science”; “What do scientists do”; "Why do scientists do experiments"; “Scientists may havedifferent even contradictory ideas, do you think it is good for science, and why”.Interviews on Epistemic Views of Science8 students from each class (i.e., n = 32) were interviewed before and after the intervention with the epistemiccognitions interview protocol to examine their epistemic and conceptual change process. The first part of theinterview questions were similar to the questionnaire items but allowed students to elaborate on their thinkingabout science; the second part had questions that mapped with the first parts but probed students’ understandingof their own inquiry process. The third part of the interview asked students to reflect how they had changed theirviews of science and conceptual understanding about electricity. These data are currently being analyzed.Conceptual UnderstandingStudents’ conceptual understanding was measured with a knowledge test containing different parts: The firsttested students’ understanding about the conductivity of different materials (e.g., metal, distilled water, juice,graphite); the second asked them to give explanation on why some materials conduct electricity, the third partasked what they knew about electricity and what questions they had. Students’ responses to the first part of thetest were scored according to the scientific correctness of answers, and their responses to the second and thirdparts were coded on a 4-point scale based on depth of explanation.Knowledge Building Engagement on ForumStudents’ knowledge building engagement was assessed with a software Analytic Toolkit (ATK) developed bythe Knowledge Building Research Team at the University of Toronto (Burtis, 1998). We selected two indices toillustrate students’ collaboration on Knowledge Forum: percentage of notes linked and percentage of notes read.Epistemic Reflection on Science (Students as Little Scientists Worksheet)As discussed earlier, the worksheet described the models and practice of four different scientists involvingconcrete day-to-day work as well as theory-building process of scientists. Students were asked to identifyaspects that were similar to what they did in knowledge building inquiry. This worksheet provides a scaffold forstudents to engage in classroom discourse; and at the same time, it provided data on students’ reflection of theirinquiry and epistemic process. A 5-point scale was developed to code the worksheet ranging from naïve,concrete, elaborated, theory-change and social-community processes of scientific progress.Analysis and ResultsCharacterization and Change of Epistemic Views of ScienceStudents’ responses to the epistemic questionnaire were coded to identify students' epistemic cognition rangingfrom viewing science as making concrete materials to an idea-driven and theory-building process. There aremany systems and this coding scheme is based on the theoretical framework, and in line with cognitive studies,different levels are included. Based on top-down and bottom-up analysis, a 4-point coding scheme wasdeveloped, for example, for one of the items on role of idea (what is science?), at level 1, students responsesshowed a rudimentary understanding focusing on concrete activities (e.g., “Science is about inventing newthings, for the convenience of people”); at level 2, students showed some awareness of the existence of abstractunseen entity in science (e.g., “Science is about investigating some questions”); at level 3, responses reflectsome understanding about the relationship between theory and experiment, and the explanatory nature ofscience (e.g., “Science is an investigation, it involves experiments; to explain all kinds of phenomenon”); atlevel 4, responses indicate a deeper understanding of theory building (e.g., “Science is about making theoriesthrough experiment, then they do different experiment to revise the theory”). For the item on scientific progressas a social process, responses at level 1 do not appreciate the role of different ideas for scientific progress (e.g.,“it is not good to have different ideas. When you have too many ideas, it is hard to find answer.”); responses atlevel 2 show some superficial understanding (e.g., “it is a good thing, you can compare and see which one isright); responses at level 3 appreciate of the role of idea interaction in science (e.g., “it is a good thing, differentideas can inspire scientists”); responses at level 4 indicated better understanding about the role of different ideasICLS 2014 Proceedings129© ISLSfor theory improvement/knowledge creation (e.g., “scientists have different ideas, they test them withexperiments; they may understand some new ideas...organize them.. and make a new theory”).To examine the intervention effects on the change of epistemic cognition over time, a 2 x 2 (group xtime) repeated measures MANOVA was performed for the scores of four scales (Table 1). The participants werenested within classes and therefore the measurements were not statistically independent, which may affect TypeI error rates. All alphas were therefore set at .01. Results revealed statistically significant multivariate effects;Follow up univariate ANOVAs revealed significant main effects for time for: role of idea, F(1,100)=85.06,p<.001, Partial eta2=.46; theory building, F(1,100)=37.07, p<.001, Partial eta2=.27; social process,F(1,100)=8.95, p<.01, Partial eta2=.08; and theory-fact understanding, F(1,100)=5.59, p<.05. Partial eta2=.05,suggesting both knowledge-building and inquiry groups improved over time. There was also a significant maineffect for groups for role of idea, theory building, and social process. Importantly, significant time x groupinteraction effects were obtained on role of idea, F(1,100)=16.89, p<.001, Partial eta2=.14, theory building,F(1,100)=9.79, p<.01, Partial eta2=.09, and social process F(1,100)=17.07, p<.001, Partial eta2=.15. Theinteraction effect was not significant for theory-fact understanding. Results indicated that knowledge-buildinggroup had more gains on epistemic views of science than did the comparison group.Table 1: Pre and posttest epistemic cognitions mean scores (SD in parentheses) across classesKnowledge building group (n=52)Comparison group (n=50)Pre-testPost-testPre-testPost-testRole of Idea1.26(.33)2.03(.66)1.12(.32)1.42(.49)Theory-Fact1.44 (.67)1.79 (.94)1.42 (.84)1.54 (.73)Theory Building1.63(.51)2.28(.70)1.36(.56)1.57(.46)Social aspect2.37(.95)3.12(.94)1.98(.87)1.86(.83)Epistemic overall6.69 (1.43)9.21 (2.07)5.88 (1.63)6.39 (1.71)Changes in Conceptual UnderstandingThe mean and SD of the pre and post scores were 1.11 (.23) and 1.55 (.18) for knowledge building group(n=52), and .94 (.14) and 1.12 (.15) for comparison group (n=50) at pre and posttest respectively. Repeatedmeasure ANOVA was conducted to test the intervention effect for conceptual understanding. The resultsshowed a time effect, F(1,99)=217.18, p<.001, Partial eta2=.687, and a group effect, F(1, 99)=1.6.31, p<.001,Partial eta2=.518. There was also a significant time and group interaction effect, F(1,99)=39.00, p<.001, Partialeta2=.283. These results indicate that both groups improved their conceptual understanding over time, but theknowledge building group had a larger gains than had the comparison group.Relations between Knowledge Building, Epistemic Views &Conceptual UnderstandingThe second question investigated the relationship among knowledge building, epistemic cognition, andconceptual understanding, and examined the prediction of different variables on posttest conceptualunderstanding. Analyses were conducted within the knowledge building groups (n=52) as ATK indices wereavailable only for this group. Correlations analyses indicated that students’ post-test conceptual understandingwas related to post-test epistemic cognition and KF-link indices. As well, students' post epistemic cognition wasrelated to their epistemic reflection. Primarily, students’ engagement in Knowledge Forum and their epistemiccognition are related to their conceptual understanding after instruction.Table 2: Correlation among post epistemic cognition, post conceptual understanding, KF collaboration (link &read), and epistemic reflection (n=52)Epistemic cognitionConceptual understandingConceptual understanding.310*1KF link0.136.304*1KF read.2420.17.287*1.377**0.143.304*0.155Epistemic reflectionNote: *p<.05; **p<.01;KF linkKF readPrediction of Prior Knowledge, Epistemic Cognition and Knowledge Forum Activities onConceptual UnderstandingHierarchical regression analyses were conducted for the knowledge-building group (n=52); first enteringpre-test scores, followed by Knowledge Forum activities, and then epistemic cognition. Results showed thatprior conceptual understanding explains 13% of variance (R2=.13), when Knowledge Forum note links wasadded, an additional 6.2% variance was explained. When post epistemic cognition was added, another furtherICLS 2014 Proceedings130© ISLS8.3% variance was explained. These results indicated that over and above prior knowledge, students’collaboration on Knowledge Forum, epistemic cognition contributed to the post conceptual understanding.Table 3.

The learning context wascoded into two variables (KB group=1, None KB group=0). Results showed that prior conceptual understandingexplained 26.7% of the variance (R2=.267). When post epistemic cognition was added, additional 27.7% of thevariance was explained. When learning context was added, additional 16.5 % of the variance was explained.Results indicated that over and above prior knowledge, epistemic cognition and knowledge buildingenvironment contributed to post-conceptual understanding.Table 4.

Consistent with the quantitative findings, qualitative analysis of students’ postinterview data also revealed the possible positive impact of knowledge building on students’ epistemic andconceptual change. Table 5 shows a comparison of two students’ reflections on their own inquiry process, onefrom the knowledge-building group and one from the comparison group.Table 5: An example of students’ interview responses about their own inquiry processStudent A (from knowledge building group)Student B (from comparison group)I: What makes a good inquiry-based discussion?I: What makes a good inquiry-basedA: Classmates will bring out questions, there will bediscussion?hypothesis, theories….new knowledge is produced in the B: everyone discusses with each other..theories.

He also appreciated the role of different ideas in improving knowledge. However,student B thought of science as activities and getting something right for new knowledge. Student A wasICLS 2014 Proceedings131© ISLSalluding to his experience as they worked on scientific inquiry and discussion. These excerpts provided someglimpses into how the knowledge-building environment enriched with epistemic reflection might haveinfluenced students’ views of science. Other examples are also included to show correspondence betweenstudents’ epistemic understanding of science and their experience with Knowledge Forum. When asked “how doyou think scientists create new knowledge”, one knowledge building student said, “scientists will construct anew theory based on previous theories. Just like the working on Knowledge Forum, you will write and typesomething under a question, and it will be revised gradually, or a new theory will be proposed.” From thisexcerpt, we can see how students’ knowledge building engagement and the visualization of ideas on KnowledgeForum may have helped them understand the theory construction process of scientists.To further understand how knowledge building may have possibly provided students with an epistemicenvironment, we examined student’s understanding of scientists’ inquiry and also reflection of their own inquiryprocess. For example, a knowledge-building student LHT reflected: “When working on Knowledge Forum,underneath different themes people posted questions…it was all about electricity, but we talked about differentaspects of it, e.g., some were wondering why salt water can conduct electricity, some others were wonderingwhy fruit can conduct electricity…. Underneath all these questions, there were different [ideas], some of whichwere theories. You might question these theories, so you asked follow-up questions. However, people might evenquestion your follow-up questions, so you had to revise it…. Some used the scaffold “your theory cannotexplain” in their responses, which means your theory might have problems. It keeps going on like this, and itbecomes a big cluster of notes full of questions, theories, and questioning etc……”. While talking about herview of scientists’ inquiry, this student mentioned a similar progressive process: “….after scientists make atheory, there may be follow-up questions….” “…Theory will change with time, when other scientists makeanother investigation of the theory, they may find some problems in it. Then they will do experiment to test….and it will be changed”. These excerpts provided glimpses into how knowledge-building inquiry, supported byKnowledge Forum, may have shaped students’ understanding about the progressive and collective nature ofscience, and helped them revise their theories and explanations through its social mechanism.Conclusion, Implications and SignificanceThis study designed a knowledge-building environment that attempts to integrate knowledge building andepistemic change theories, and examined the role of such design in facilitating epistemic and conceptual changein fifth graders. In the process, we developed a coding scheme to examine children's epistemic understanding ofscience focusing on role of idea, theory-fact understanding, theory building and social process of scientificprogress. Consistent with the research of Carey et al. (1989) and Smith et al. (2000), results showed variationamong these participants ranging from seeing scientific inquiry as concrete activity to viewing it as anidea-driven theory-building process. As well, these children demonstrated understanding of scientific progressas propelled by inquiry and social processes in a community. Our findings showed that grade 5 studentsworking in the knowledge-building environment obtained significantly more changes towards moresophisticated views of scientific inquiry, compared to students in the regular inquiry-based classes; and theyalso obtained higher scores on conceptual understanding of electricity. To understand the relationships amongknowledge building, epistemic understanding, and conceptual understanding, correlation and hierarchicalregression analysis were conducted. It was found that knowledge building environment and post epistemicunderstanding significantly contributed to students’ post conceptual understanding. Chan and Lam (2010)examined role of knowledge-building in facilitating epistemic and conceptual growth, the current studyextended it to integrate epistemic dimensions in the knowledge-building design and suggested the importance ofhelping students to become aware of and resolve their epistemic doubt by scaffolding their collective epistemicinquiry and reflection for epistemic change.In this study, the key design involved scaffolding children’s work as “communities of scientists” andknowledge builders pursuing inquiry into problems, constructing explanations, using authoritative sources ofinformation, improving their ideas and pursing for collective inquiry and new knowledge. While most studies onknowledge building have examined elementary children's scientific understanding, we explicitly focused onhelping students to have epistemic reflection. We attempted to help students to reflect on the nature and processof science focusing on theory building as they experienced their own knowledge building processes when theystudied electricity. Qualitative analysis of students’ interview reflection suggested how the designedenvironment may have helped students understand science as a collective theory building process, andsubsequently helped them revise and improve their theories and explanation.Although scientific inquiry is much emphasized, students often think of science as lists of activities andskills rather than an idea-driven and theory-building process for creation of new knowledge. This study exploreda design that helped students to mirror their understanding of science with their engagement in knowledgebuilding inquiry, that merits further investigation. As well, the study extended the line of inquiry on epistemicunderstanding of science that focused on the role of idea in science, and expanded on social and communityprocesses of scientific progress; these findings suggest possible research direction on examining social aspectsICLS 2014 Proceedings132© ISLSof epistemic cognition. This study is an ongoing study and further analyses of process dynamics would beundertaken to examine the nature of collaborative discourse on Knowledge Forum, and to understand theepistemic and conceptual change mechanism (e.g., the role of epistemic doubt) so as to provide a more coherentpicture about the relationship among knowledge building, epistemic cognition, and conceptual understanding.ReferencesBendixen, L.
