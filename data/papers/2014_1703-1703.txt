Constructing Assessment ItemsThat Blend Core Ideas and Science PracticesAngela Haydel DeBarger, SRI InternationalJoseph Krajcik, Michigan State University)Christopher Harris, SRI InternationalAbstract: How do you measure knowledge in use? In this workshop, participants will applyprinciples of Evidence-Centered Design to construct assessments that meet the ambitious goalof integrating disciplinary core ideas with practices, much like in the Next Generation ScienceStandards. In small groups, participants will unpack assessable components of sciencestandards and construct learning goals that integrate aspects of core ideas and sciencepractices. Participants will learn design principles for specifying evidence that students needto meet the learning goals and define task features to elicit the desired evidence. Using thesedesign principles, participants will craft items and rubrics.ICLS 2014 Proceedings1703Â© ISLS
