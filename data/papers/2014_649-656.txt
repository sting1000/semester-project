Inprior work, we found that when providing verbal justifications, learners’ speech patternspredict whether their justifications are mathematically sound. However, current views on theembodied nature of cognition suggest that actions and speech may co-constitute reasoningprocesses. The current study investigated whether the gestures learners use while formulatingproofs also predict proof validity. 120 undergraduates provided verbal justifications for twomathematical tasks. We analyzed speech patterns in participants’ justifications using textanalysis software, and we coded participants’ gestures as dynamic or static. Results showedthat dynamic gestures were correlated with mathematically valid proofs and with specificpatterns of speech. A stepwise logistic regression model found that speech and gestureseparately account for unique variance in a model predicting proof validity, indicating thatgesture contributes to mathematical reasoning in an abstract task domain.IntroductionRecent research has highlighted ways that mathematical cognition is embodied, or formulated throughperception and action, and has specifically identified gesture as an important cognitive resource for mathematicslearning. In mathematics classrooms, teachers and students spontaneously use gesture to connect disparatemathematical representations and ideas (Alibali et al., 2014; Alibali & Nathan, 2012; Nathan et al., 2013).Teachers’ strategic use of gestures can support appropriate mathematical generalizations (Radford, 2003), andattending to students’ gestures is important when evaluating their mathematical reasoning (Boncoddo et al.,2013; Nemirovsky & Ferrera, 2009; Williams et al., 2012). The present study is part of an emerging researchprogram investigating how gesture and action can influence students’ mathematical cognition. We identify thedifferent types of speech and gestures that students use as they generate and communicate mathematical proofs.We examine how these speech and gesture categories relate to mathematically valid proofs in order to betterunderstand how learners can be supported in adopting proof practices.The ICLS theme, “Learning and Becoming in Practice,” is particularly relevant for this line ofinvestigation. Recent in situ classroom research has shown that teachers and students in mathematics andengineering classrooms spontaneously use gesture to enact connections across representations (Alibali et al.,2014; Nathan et al., 2013). In some cases, by using gesture and body-based action, they can effectively becomethe mathematical objects and relations they intend to convey. For example, students and teachers often use theirbodies to dynamically simulate mathematical objects and relations, such as representing changes in linear slopeswith an arm (Alibali & Nathan, 2012). When the body is used as a tool for depicting and understanding a fluid ,moving transformation of a mathematical entity, we refer to this as a dynamic depictive gesture (Walkington etal., this volume).In this work, we examine how the production both of dynamic depictive gestures and of particularspeech patterns (e.g., “if… then” statements) is associated with valid proofs. Our goal is to understand thecomplex interplay between learners’ use of gesture and speech as they produce mathematical justifications.While many studies have examined discourse patterns or gesture patterns in isolation, research on how these twomodalities interact and work together to form complex patterns of interpersonal, embodied communication ismore rare (though, see Radford, 2003). Here, we take a novel approach in which we use quantitative measuresof speech and gesture to predict accuracy of justifications for mathematical tasks. The emergence of recentsoftware tools for automated text analysis, coupled with the identification of dynamic gestures duringmathematical reasoning from video-based classroom studies, gives us leverage in understanding how speech andgesture contribute to proof practices.ICLS 2014 Proceedings649© ISLSTheoretical FrameworkThe Importance of Proof Practices in MathematicsBoth the Common Core State Standards (2010) and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)Standards (2000) identify constructing mathematical arguments and engaging in proof practices as crucialcomponents of mathematical understanding. In addition, constructing valid proofs is central to both theprofessional domain of mathematics and mathematics education (Schoenfield, 1994), as it is the means by whichmathematicians communicate key ideas and novel understandings to each other. However, student difficultieswith proof are well documented (e.g., Harel & Sowder; Dreyfus, 1999; Knuth, Choppin, & Bieda, 2009);therefore, there is a need to explore how to better identify and support valid proof practices. We follow Hareland Sowder’s (2005) definition of proof as the process of reasoning about a conjecture and communicating thebelieved truth or falseness of the conjecture, and consequently we use the terms proof and justificationinterchangeably. According to Harel and Sowder (2005), mathematically valid proofs must be (1) general innature, such that they hold for all cases, (2) based on logical inferences in which conclusions are drawn fromvalid premises, and (3) based on operational thought, in which there is progression through goals and subgoals.Harel and Sowder’s (2005) taxonomy focuses on traditional methods of communicating proof with written andspoken language. Although mathematical proofs often are verbalized instead of formally written in K-12classrooms, the content and structure of students’ speech alone may not provide a complete picture of students’mathematical knowledge. In particular, studies have shown that people often express information in gesturesthat they do not express in speech (Alibali & Goldin-Meadow, 1993; Alibali & Kita, 2010; Nathan & Johnson,2010; Williams et al., 2012). We therefore argue that the body is an important modality in whichcomplementary or even novel mathematical information can be communicated. In this work, we extend Hareland Sowder’s (2005) framework by invoking views of embodied cognition to include gestures as an additionalmeans of supporting both mathematical cognition and mathematical communication.Gestures and Embodiment in Proof PracticesTheories of embodied cognition reject traditional views of cognition as based on manipulating amodal symbolsystems in the brain based on purely syntactic rules (Shapiro, 2011). In contrast, within an embodiedframework, cognition comprises a mutual feedback loop between the brain and the body. For example, gesturesmay reveal cognitive processes, and the process of gesturing in turn affects those cognitive processes (Alibali &Nathan, 2012; Goldin-Meadow, Cook, & Mitchell, 2009; Hostetter & Alibali, 2008; Shapiro, 2011). Severalembodied cognition scholars (Barsalou, 2008; Hostetter & Alibali, 2008) acknowledge the role of gesture assimulated action that reenacts perceptual, motor, and mental states that arise from prior experience. In this work,we investigate whether certain types of gesture are associated with valid proof construction. We draw uponwork by Göksun, Goldin-Meadow, Newcombe, and Shipley (2013), who categorized gestures used in a mentalrotation task as “static” if they referred to individual objects, and “dynamic” if they indicated movement such asrotation or direction. Newcombe and Shipley (2012) also differentiate static gestures, those that indicate spatialfeatures or locations, versus dynamic gestures that transform spatial features or locations. We build upon thesedefinitions by operationalizing simulated actions as static depictive gestures if the hands display a fixed,unchanging mathematical object and dynamic depictive gestures if the hands are used to enact transformationson mathematical entities and relations. We refer to these in the rest of the paper simply as “dynamic” or “static”gestures, but we are referring to the dynamic and static nature of the objects, and not whether or not the gestureitself contains movement. We make this distinction because we believe that dynamic gestures are closelyrelated to learners’ use of simulated action to represent multiple cases and fluid transformations betweendepicted entities, which can promote sophisticated mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, our prior work hasfound a significant correlation between using dynamic gestures and generating valid mathematical justificationsacross six different mathematical tasks (Walkington et al., this volume).Use of Speech in Proof PracticesAlthough theories of embodied cognition underscore the importance of the body when engaging in cognitivetasks such as proof production, proofs themselves are linguistic in nature. Mathematical proofs can be thoughtof as a specific kind of disciplinary discourse practice (e.g., Gee, 2007; Gresalfi & Cobb, 2006), and in K-12classrooms, proofs often take spoken––rather than formal, written––forms (Healy & Hoyles, 2000). Here wefocus on mathematical proofs that are communicated through spoken language and gesture, hypothesizing thatspecific features of participants’ speech patterns may be important for constructing valid proofs. Speech patternscan be analyzed at many levels for a variety of features. For example, we could quantitatively assess how oftenpeople use pronouns, adjectives, or words relating to different topics, such as work or socializing, when they arespeaking. We could also quantify how much overlap there is between different words or sentences in a block ofcontinuous speech, or what tense a person tends to use. Indeed, the recent emergence of software-based textmining tools has allowed us to better understand characteristics of human speech that are associated withICLS 2014 Proceedings650© ISLSlearners’ making gains in conceptual understanding (see Jeon & Azevedo, 2007; Williams & D’Mello, 2010).When people are asked to verbally construct mathematical justifications, some of these quantitative measures oftheir speech may be indicative of a well-constructed, logically sound mathematical argument. By understandingthe verbal properties of valid proofs, we can better grasp how to scaffold learners to adopt successful proofpractices.Hypotheses and PredictionsThis study investigates how gestures, speech patterns, and the production of valid proofs are associated with oneanother. In doing so, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of whether—and how—gestures provideadditional information, beyond speech, about the validity of students’ verbally communicated proofs. This leadsus to formulate two hypotheses: Hypothesis 1 states that speech and gesture may constitute equivalent butdistinct manifestations of the same underlying cognitive processes that result in participants’ generating validproofs. In other words, while both speech and gesture may each predict valid proofs separately, together theyprovide redundant measures of the same underlying construct relating to valid mathematical reasoning.Alternatively, Hypothesis 2 claims that speech and gesture may indicate distinct underlying cognitive processesinvolved in proof production. For instance, gestures may reveal distinct aspects of the learner’s mental actionbased simulations that are not conveyed in their speech patterns. In order to test these competing hypotheses, weformulated the following research questions. Research Question 1 asks, Is the use of dynamic gesturecorrelated with the validity of one’s proof? This enables us to investigate whether gesture does, in fact, provideinformation about proof validity. Research Question 2 asks, Are particular speech patterns correlated with thevalidity of one’s proof? This allows us to capture what characteristics of speech tend to indicate logical andvalid mathematical reasoning. Research Question 3 asks, Are dynamic gestures correlated with the use ofparticular speech patterns during the proof process? If speech and gesture are highly correlated with one another,but accounting for both does not improve the model’s prediction of the validity of participants’ proofs, then thiswould provide evidence for Hypothesis 1. In order to allow for the falsification of Hypothesis 1 in favor ofHypothesis 2, Research Question 4 asks, Do speech and dynamic gestures contribute uniquely to models forpredicting proof validity? An affirmative response would indicate support for Hypothesis 2, which stipulatesthat gesture and speech reveal distinct underlying processes of proof practices.MethodsUndergraduates (N = 120) (M age = 19.2 years, 51% female) enrolled in a psychology course at a largeMidwestern university were prompted to verbally justify two tasks from distinct mathematical domains: onerelating to planar geometry, the other to an inference about parity in the number system. Participants read eachconjecture (order was counterbalanced) out loud and were prompted to think aloud as they verbalized theirjustifications. The first task was, “Mary came up with the following conjecture: ‘For any triangle, the sum of thelength of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.’ Provide a justification as to whyMary’s conjecture is true or false.” The second task was, “An unknown number of gears are connected togetherin a chain. If you know what direction the first gear turns, how could you figure out what direction the last gearturns? Provide a justification as to why your answer is true.”Coding of Proof AccuracyParticipants were asked to think aloud as they provided their justifications, and videotapes of the sessions wereuploaded into Transana, a software program that allows for transcribing and analyzing video data (Woods &Fassnacht, 2012). After transcription, the videos were split into 240 separate transcripts (one for each task foreach participant). Based on the verbal transcript and video, each justification was each coded as Valid (1) orInvalid (0) based on Harel and Sowder’s (2005) definition of valid proofs. Examples of spoken valid and invalidproofs for each of the two tasks are shown in Table 1. Overall, 40.8% and 50% of participants provided validproofs for the gear and triangle tasks, respectively. Inter-rater reliability for coding the validity of participants’justifications was high, with a Kappa value of 0.84 for a 20% subset.Coding of SpeechThe 240 transcripts were analyzed using the LiWC (Pennebaker, Booth, & Francis, 2007) and Coh-Metrix(Graesser, McNamara, Louwerse, & Cai, 2004) text analysis software programs. LiWC comprises variousdictionaries of words assigned to different topic categories, such as social process words (e.g., words relating tofamily or friends) and cognitive process words (e.g., words describing causation or certainty). LiWC’s outputconsists of the percentage of words the participants used from each dictionary. LiWC provides a measure of thecontent of a text, whereas the second text-mining program, Coh-Metrix, analyzes the quality of a text. CohMetrix contains 108 different indicators of text readability (for a full list, see http://cohmetrix.memphis.edu),which are broadly organized into categories such as syntactic simplicity, word concreteness, and deep cohesion.Coh-Metrix’s output provides continuous quantitative measures of the degree to which these characteristics areICLS 2014 Proceedings651© ISLSpresent in a text. Therefore, using both software programs in conjunction allows for analysis of the technicalaspects of the language and readability gathered from Coh-Metrix, as well as the content and topic of thelanguage that participants use from LiWC, providing a more holistic picture of the nature of participants’speech. We included all speech categories from LiWC and Coh-Metrix in our analyses, with the exception ofcategories specific to the number of paragraphs or number of sentences, as we were using natural speech insteadof written text, and these demarcations vary greatly by transcription norms.Table 1: Examples of spoken valid and invalid participant proofs from each taskProof TypeTriangle,ValidTriangle,InvalidGear,ValidGear,InvalidExample"Mary's conjecture is true, because if the one side is long–is longer than the sum of the other twosides then the other two sides won't be able to touch at the top and it won't be a triangle.”“That isn't true. Uh it's false because you could have a triangle where one side is very long and theother two sides are shorter, um very short, and so they add up to a length that is shorter than thelongest side.”"Um obviously the gear after the first one turns in the opposite direction and the next one turns inthe opposite direction and so on and so on, so I guess if there's an odd number of gears it will turnin the same direction as the first gear and if there's an even number of gears it'll turn in theopposite direction.”“Um I feel that all the gears should turn the same way because it's a chain reaction so it shouldturn in the same direction as the first gear.”Coding of GesturesThe 240 video clips were also coded for whether participants generated dynamic or static gestures whileengaging in proof activities. For both the triangle and gear tasks, we coded a gesture as Static if participantsindicated a single entity with their hands, but coded it as Dynamic if they indicated multiple entities that wereconnected together via a depicted relationship. For the triangle task, an example of a Static gesture would beindicating a side of a triangle or a full triangle, whereas a Dynamic gesture would be fluidly depicting severaldifferent sized triangles in a row to show a transformation, or showing a single triangle that grew in size. For thegear task, an example of a Static gesture would be portraying a single gear moving in one direction, whereas aDynamic gesture would be two gears moving in the same or in opposite directions, or a chain of gears turning inalternate directions. Note that the distinction is not between gestures that “move” versus those that “don’tmove,” since gestures that don’t move can still simulate action or perceptual change. Instead, the distinction liesin whether participants used gestures to represent multiple mathematical objects that were related to oneanother. Table 2 provides images of participants creating each of these gesture types. A complete clip was codedas Dynamic (1) if it contained any instances of dynamic gestures. A clip was coded as Not Dynamic (0) if itcontained only static gestures or no gestures. Our Kappa reliability value for a subset of 30 video clips (12.5%subset from a total of 240 videos; 15 gear, 15 triangle) was 0.85. This was for the categories of “No Gestures,”“Static Only” and “Dynamic,” which were assigned holistically to the entire clip (both attempts).Table 2: Examples of dynamic and static gesturesTaskTriangleExample of Dynamic GestureExample of Static GestureParticipant uses bothhands to make two sides ofa triangle and fluentlymoves from making aflattened triangle to anormal triangle.Participant uses bothhands to create a fulltriangle that does notmove or change.Participant uses bothhands to show two gearsmoving in oppositedirections.Participant uses rightindex finger to show asingle gear turning in onedirection.GearICLS 2014 Proceedings652© ISLSResults and DiscussionTo examine relations among gesture, speech categories, and proof validity, we calculated Pearson correlationcoefficients and examined those correlations that were both in the same direction (positive or negative) andsignificant for both the gear and triangle tasks. The following three sections detail the results of those analyses.Dynamic Gestures and Valid ProofsIn order to answer Research Question 1, we investigated the correlation between dynamic gesture and proofvalidity. Results showed that participants who used dynamic gestures were more likely to produce valid proofsthan those who did not, both on the triangle task (r = 0.454, p < .001) and on the gear task (r = 0.255, p =.005)—that is, across two distinct mathematical domains. We also looked at the correlations between staticgesture and valid proofs; static gestures were significantly negatively correlated with valid proofs for thetriangle task (r = -0.183, p = .045), but were not significantly related to the validity of proofs for the gear task.However, a prior exploratory study showed that the relationship between dynamic gestures and valid proofsholds across six different mathematical tasks (Walkington et al., this volume). By answering Research Question1 affirmatively, we do not directly falsify either of our competing hypotheses, but it was important to establishthe relationship between dynamic gesture and proof validity prior to answering our other research questions.Speech Categories and Valid ProofsTo answer Research Question 2, we investigated the correlation between proof validity and the speechcategories derived from LiWC and Coh-Metrix. In prior analyses of this data set (Pier et al., 2014), we foundthat four speech categories were predictive in regression models of valid proofs across the two tasks: Presenttense verbs, lexical diversity (as measured by the type-token ratio for content words), discrepancy words, andtemporal connectives. Of those four categories, use of the present tense and type-token ratio were eachnegatively correlated with valid proofs, while use of discrepancy words and use of temporal connectives wereeach positively correlated with valid proofs. Table 3 describes each of the speech categories that weresignificantly correlated with valid proofs.Table 3: Speech categories significantly correlated with valid proofsSpeech CategoryPresent tenseLLexical diversity(type-token ratio)CDescription of Speech CategoryTriangle TaskGear TaskVerbs in the present tenser = -0.280**r = -0.328***Ratio of the number of unique words (types) dividedr = -0.280**r = -0.500***by the number of times that word occurs (tokens);higher ratios indicate more unique wordsDiscrepancyWords in LiWC Discrepancy dictionary, e.g.,r = 0.264**r = 0.202*wordsL“could,” “would,” “should”TemporalWords connecting clauses that indicate time order,r = 0.265**r = 0.240**ConnectivesCe.g., “before,” “then,” “after”Note. *p < .05, **p < .01, and ***p < .001. L is a measure from LiWC, and C a measure from Coh-Metrix.Following the methodology used by Pier et al. (2014), we systematically investigated the 20 transcriptsthat scored highest and the 20 that scored lowest on each category in order to determine which aspects of thetranscripts seemed to be associated with high or low scores on each of these linguistic categories. Theseanalyses revealed that the negative correlation between proof validity and present tense was due to participants’use of self-conscious statements such as, “I don’t know,” or “I don’t understand.” The negative correlation withtype-token ratio indicated that participants with high type-token ratios verbalized more varied, unrelated words,lacking continuity of ideas. In contrast, participants with a low type-token ratio repeated a consistent set ofwords related to reasoning through the conjecture. Finally, using both discrepancy words and temporalconnectives stemmed from more conditional (i.e., “if…then”) statements indicating participants were makinglogical inferences—one of the features of valid proofs per the proof scheme from Harel and Sowder (2005).Dynamic Gestures and Speech CategoriesIn order to answer Research Question 3, whether gesture use is correlated with speech patterns during the proofprocess, we investigated the correlations between dynamic gesture and speech categories from LiWC and CohMetrix. Although we also calculated correlations between static gesture and speech categories, none of thesewere both statistically significant and in the same direction (positive or negative) for both tasks. Table 4describes each of the speech categories that were significantly correlated with dynamic gestures. Four speechcategories were negatively correlated with dynamic gestures (present tense, quantifiers, insight words, andcognitive processes words), whereas three speech categories were positively correlated with dynamic gestures(deep cohesion, all connectives, and temporal connectives). Thus, not only are dynamic gesture and speech eachICLS 2014 Proceedings653© ISLSindividually correlated with valid proofs, but they are correlated with one another; furthermore, many of thesame categories that were found in prior work to be significantly predictive of proof validity in speech are alsosignificantly correlated with dynamic gesture (i.e., present tense and temporal connectives) (Pier et al., 2014).However, in order to evaluate our competing hypotheses, we need to address Research Question 4: whetherspeech and gesture explain unique variance in determining proof validity, or whether they instead explainoverlapping, redundant variance in proof validity.We again systematically investigated the transcripts with the 20 highest and 20 lowest scores for eachspeech category. We found that when participants frequently mentioned their own mental state or cognitiveprocessing, they were not likely to produce dynamic gestures relevant to the proofs, since they seemed to focusmore on their thinking than on the content of the proof. Such patterns resulted in negative correlations betweendynamic gestures and the categories of present tense, insight words, and cognitive processes words.Table 4: Speech categories significantly correlated with dynamic gestureSpeech CategoryPresent tenseLQuantifiers LDescription of Speech CategoryTriangle Task Gear TaskVerbs in the present tenser = -0.188*r = -0.207*Words referring to general quantities, e.g., “all,” “more,”r = -0.184*r = -0.200*“greater”Insight wordsLWords in LiWC Insight dictionary, e.g., “think,” “know,” r = -0.214*r = -0.337***“understand”CognitiveWords in LiWC Cognitive Processes dictionary, e.g.,r = -0.228*r = -0.321***processes wordsL “ought,” “know,” “cause”Deep cohesionCIncidence of causal and intentional connectives,r = 0.257**r = 0.217*indicating higher coherenceAll connectivesCIncidence of all connective words, i.e., conjunctionsr = 0.267**r = 0.225*TemporalWords connecting clauses that indicate time order, e.g.,r = 0.248**r = 0.214*connectivesC“before,” “then,” “after”Note. *p < .05, **p < .01, and ***p < .001. L is a measure from LiWC, and C a measure from Coh-Metrix.Additionally, when participants used temporal connectives and connectives more generally tocohesively link together different statements, they tended to produce dynamic gestures. Both dynamic gesturesand verbal statements with connective words typically express relationships between entities; thus, reasoningabout relationships relevant to the proof content was manifested in the production both of cohesive speech anddynamic gestures. This drove the positive correlations between dynamic gesture and the speech categories ofdeep cohesion, all connectives, and temporal connectives.Stepwise Regression AnalysisTo answer Research Question 4, we assessed whether speech and gesture each explained unique variance in themodels’ predicting proof validity. We ran two stepwise logistic regression analyses using the lmer() function(Bates & Maechler, 2010) in the R software environment. In each model, participant was a random effect andtask (i.e., gear, triangle) was a fixed effect. The outcome was whether the participant generated a valid proof forthe task, coded as a 0 or 1. Interactions were tested for significance, but none were present in the final model. Inthe first analysis, we added predictors in the following order: Dynamic gesture, speech categories significantlyassociated with dynamic gestures, and speech categories significantly associated with valid proofs. Predictorswere tested for inclusion in the model using the anova() function, which uses a chi-square reference distributionto test for significant reductions in deviance. In the second analysis, we added predictors in the following order:Speech categories significantly associated with valid proofs, speech categories significantly associated withdynamic gestures, and dynamic gestures. Thus, in one analysis we added terms for dynamic gestures into themodel first, and in the other analysis we added dynamic gestures last into the model. Both analyses resulted inthe same final model, so we only discuss the results in terms of one stepwise regression analysis. Furthermore,we included controls for the word count of each proof, but this factor was not a significant covariate.Table 5 provides the results of the stepwise regression. Three of the speech categories were significantpredictors of valid proofs: discrepancy words (z = 4.21, p < .001), type-token ratio of content words (z = -3.08, p= .0020), and cognitive processes words (z = -3.29, p = .001). Also, use of dynamic gestures was a significant,positive predictor of valid proofs (z = 3.00, p = .003). Adding in the speech category predictors reduced theoverall deviance of the model by 24.1% (χ2(3) = 74.75, p < .001 ), and adding the dynamic gesture predictorreduced the deviance by an additional 7.0% (χ2(1) = 16.44, p < .001 ). Overall, language and gesture predictorscombined accounted for approximately 30% of the variance in whether participants generated valid proofs.The regression analyses thus answer Research Question 4 by demonstrating that dynamic gesturesuniquely predict the validity of proofs, which provides support for Hypothesis 2. This means that while bothICLS 2014 Proceedings654© ISLSspeech and gesture independently predict whether or not a participant verbalized a valid proof, there is distinctinformation in each modality. In other words, gesture and speech are not redundant, but instead appear toprovide unique but related insight into the cognitive processes involved in successful proof construction. Thus,consideration of both speech and gesture is important to understanding the depths of students’ understandings—and misunderstandings.Table 5: Stepwise regression analysis resultsEstimateStd.

Instead, gesture and speech each provide unique insight into student proof generation. Froman embodied cognition perspective, these findings underscore the idea that since gesture and speech conveysome distinct information, both are important components of cognitive processing to consider when evaluatingstudent performance on a task, such as valid proof construction. In other words, although a student may not beable to specifically articulate a valid mathematical proof, his or her gestures can shed light on potential keymathematical insights that he or she possesses but is not yet able to verbalize. However, as with any study, ourconclusions are limited by our measurement techniques; there may be other components of language that areimportant to proof construction that our tools were not able to capture, or other ways of classifying gesture thatwould allow for even more explanatory power. In addition, examining these patterns across more mathematicaltasks would certainly be useful. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that attending to student gestures couldassist teachers in diagnosing student misunderstandings when formulating mathematical proofs.In addition, given that learners typically struggle to grasp the discursive, logical structure of explicitproof statements even with continued instruction, interventions seeking to change students’ gestures may offer afeasible alternative channel for learning. Teachers could model and encourage students to use dynamic gesturesin the classroom, while concurrently accentuating the importance of language-based aspects of proof. Therefore,understanding how gesture can uniquely explain proof validity can inform potential educational interventions.Overall, this work indicates that gestures have explanatory power about students’ mathematicalknowledge and skills above and beyond that available from speech alone. Understanding the complex interplaybetween gesture and speech as reasoning unfolds is critical to supporting students in engaging in mathematicslearning. By creating environments in which students engage in justification practices using both gesture andspeech, we can help students to “learn and become” as they take part in mathematical practices.ReferencesAlibali, M.
