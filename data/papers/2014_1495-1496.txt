Sink or Swim: Understanding the Evolution of User Behaviors in anOnline Educational CommunityMin Yuan, Lei Ye, Mimi ReckerUtah State University, Logan, Utah{min.yuan, lei.ye}@aggiemail.usu.edu, mimi.recker @usu.eduAbstract: Online educational communities provide spaces for teachers to find resources,create instructional activities, and share these activities with others. Engagement with suchonline communities can be affected by how participants were initially recruited and supported.But what happens when these support and dissemination are removed? This study investigatesthe evolution of user behaviors after dissemination activities are completed. The resultssuggest that once dissemination activities ended, users’ consumer behaviors continued whiletheir contributor behaviors decreased.IntroductionTeachers are increasingly turning to online resources to customize lessons, update their lesson plans, andprovide additional materials to meet their students’ varied needs (Charles & Rice, 2012). In tandem, tools havebeen developed to facilitate teachers’ selection and usage of online resources, and to establish online educationalcommunities (OEC) around these resources (Windle, 2000). In an OEC, teachers can engage in differentactivities, such as actively designing instructional activities with selected resources, voluntarily sharing theirdesigned activities, or learning from others (Nonnecke, Andrews, & Preece, 2006).Studies of the long term patterns of activity in OEC show that some communities exist and thrive withgrowing number of users, while other communities shrink with fewer users and less participation (Iriberri &Leroy, 2009). Research has suggested that appropriate support and dissemination activities (e.g., workshops)can well keep users’ interests and encourage their participation, and thus enhance online communities’development (Schlager, Fusco, Schank, 2002).Different user types have also been identified based on their practices in an online community: “lurkers”generally take a non-participatory role and simply view other members’ contributions. “Non-lurkers” take on amore active role by creating and sharing their content within the community (Bishop, 2006). Clearunderstanding of the usage pattern trends for different users in an OEC, especially their behavioral changesduring and after dissemination activities, will add to the knowledge of how to attract new users, to increase theloyalty of existing users, and to improve the overall health of existing communities (Panciera, Priedhorsky,Erickson, & Terveen, 2010).The purpose of this study is to understand the evolution of teachers’ behaviors based around a free,web-based tool called the Instructional Architect (IA.usu.edu) (Recker, 2006). Within the IA online community,teachers can access online resources to create, publish, and share instructional activities (called IA projects)while also viewing contributions from other teachers. In particular, this study aims to identify what types ofbehaviors in the IA community are most affected when dissemination activities end, thus providing suggestionsfor how to sustain OEC.Research Design and MethodsThis study addresses the following two research questions:1. What were the usage pattern trends for IA users after dissemination activities ended (called the nodissemination period)?2. How did the IA non-lurkers’ behaviors change between the active-dissemination period and theno-dissemination period?The active-dissemination period (July, 2009 – June, 2011) refers to the time period with active supportand dissemination activities (e.g., workshops) in the IA, while the no-dissemination period refers to the samelength of time after dissemination activities ended (July, 2011 – June, 2013). IA’s visitor traffic data werecollected from Google Analytics and the IA database.ResultsRQ1: Usage trends for all IA users within the IA online community during the no-dissemination period areshown in Figure 1. As can be seen, IA usage continued despite the end of active dissemination activities. Also,note the trough in usage happened during the summer break when teachers had fewer teaching responsibilities.RQ2: The non-lurkers can be actively involved in the IA online community in the following ways:logging in, creating IA projects, publishing IA projects, copying others’ IA projects, and using online resources.Table 1 compares non-lurkers’ behaviors between active-dissemination and no-dissemination periods in termsICLS 2014 Proceedings1495© ISLSof these five activities. As can be seen, non-lurkers show declines for all five activities, with the largest drop inthe “number of IA projects copied from others” and the smallest drop in the “number of IA public projectscreated”.Figure 1.

With the end of active dissemination, users’ consumer behaviors continued,which can be seen in the monthly visits data. However, users’ contributor behaviors decreased, such as creatingand sharing fewer IA projects. These results suggest that support and dissemination play a role in keeping nonlurkers’ interest and loyalty. Future work will address the varying degrees of decline in non-lurkers’ behaviors,examine lurker’s behavior in more depth, and identify possible dissemination mechanisms to encourage activeparticipation, thereby retaining the non-lurkers’ interests and turning lurkers into non-lurkers.ReferencesCharles, K., & Rice, O.
