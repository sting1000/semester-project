An important challenge is for researchers to organize design to leverage both theexpertise of practitioners and that of researchers in an equitable arrangement. This studyexamines such an arrangement by analyzing the joint work of a design-based research-practicepartnership. It focuses on the design tensions (Tatar, 2007) associated with coordinating theneeds of participants from three different tiers of design—involving teachers, researchers, anddistrict administrators—related to the content of designs and to the mechanisms for bringingcontent to scale within the district. This study argues for the value of a common vision anddesign methodology to enable design tensions at multiple levels to become generativeinfluences on design.Major Issues AddressedGiven the seemingly intractable nature of some of the problems facing education today, it seems reasonable toapproach these problems in a different manner in hopes of developing a novel solution. One such approachincludes developing expertise horizontally across multiple dimensions rather than vertically within a singledimension for individuals and communities (Engeström, Engeström, & Karkkainen, 1995; Gutiérrez, Hunter, &Azurbiaga, 2009). In such an arrangement, those who possess the ability to leverage knowledge from differentdomains and viewpoints will more likely develop a novel solution than those who approach the problem withvertical or isolated expertise (Engeström et al., 1995).Leveraging expertise is a central challenge in design. Design research is premised on the idea thatmultiple forms of expertise are needed to develop powerful, usable, and practical innovations to improvelearning (Collins, Brown, & Bielaczyc, 2004). Teachers are often participants in design research, most often asimplementers of designs (Ormel et al., 2012). Sometimes, their involvement is structured to be more equitable,as in co-design (Penuel, Roschelle, & Shechtman, 2007).Research-practice partnerships (RPPs) are long-term, mutualistic collaborations between practitionersand researchers that are intentionally organized to investigate problems of practice and solutions for improvingdistrict outcomes (Coburn, Penuel, & Geil, 2013). RPPs are aimed at increasing the relevance and usefulness ofresearch for practitioners to support instructional improvement at scale (National Research Council, 2003).Some RPPs are design research partnerships, that is, they are organized with the aim of designing innovationsthat can have an impact on entire educational systems, such as school districts.This study uses a design tensions framework (Tatar, 2007) to analyze how the organization of a designresearch partnership successfully leverages horizontal arrangements of expertise in order to solve complexproblems in a way that accounts for multiple perspectives. Studying RPPs can provide practical insights intohow the research-practice gap between traditionally insular research universities and traditionally isolatedschool practitioners can be made narrower through joint activity. Such efforts, however, rarely unfold withoutcomplications. This study seeks to highlight the effect of tensions on the design process within the RPP, thebenefit of a shared vision among participants, and routines for identifying alternate perspectives on design inpartnership work. Specifically, this study examines how tensions of scaling can still become issues ofproductive design rather than disrupting design. As such, its primary aim is to contribute to our understanding ofthe practices of design in the learning sciences, particularly how these practices can be organized to effectimprovement at scale.ContextualizationDuring the past two years, researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder and a large research-non-profitin conjunction with leaders and teachers from a large urban school district in the northeastern United States haveengaged in joint work as part of a RPP funded by the National Science Foundation through a multi-year grant.The overall aim of this partnership seeks to support the instructional goals of the district through the design andimplementation of a digital platform called EdTrex. EdTrex will allow for the customization of the district’scurriculum in 9th grade Algebra, enhancing it with high-quality mathematical tasks aligned to the Common CoreState Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M) while simultaneously increasing teachers’ understanding of theCCSS-M through professional development as part of the co-design process.ICLS 2014 Proceedings1171© ISLSThe RPP under study here has an interwoven “multi-tiered” structure. Figure 1 presents a schematic ofthe overlapping organization of design activity within the RPP. One tier, dubbed the “leadership tier,” involvesregular meetings between district leaders, researchers, and designers to plan activities for the year in regards tothe customization of the district’s Algebra curriculum through the EdTrex platform as well as determineavenues for eventually bringing the EdTrex project to scale across the entire district. Another tier involvesregular meetings between the project leadership tier and a Teacher Design Team (TDT) comprised of otherpractitioners in the district in order to engage them in co-design activities for EdTrex. Yet another group meetsregularly to discuss the research and engineering aspects of the project. Researchers and designers from theuniversity and research non-profit participate in these sessions.Despite the potential affordances of direct collaboration between education researchers and educationpractitioners, productive and sustained examples of such deeply collaborative partnerships remain rare. RPPsprovide a collaborative structure with which to implement in practice a means of addressing this lack ofcoordination of expertise between schools and academia. A need for understanding how such RPPs engage injoint work—notably the nature of breakdowns and tensions that arise and affect the efficacy of collaboration aswell as possible avenues for their amelioration—still remains. For those in the learning sciences communitypursuing similar collaborations around bridging the research-practice gap, this study offers fundamental issuesof collaborative design research to consider. Specifically, this study seeks to add to our understanding of designtensions framework methodology through its analysis of tensions in a multi-tiered, tripartite RPP participating injoint design work.Figure 1. Overlapping activity structure of the multi-tiered EdTrex RPP.Theoretical FrameworkFocusing on the joint design work undertaken by the three tiers of the RPP, particularly the breakdowns andtensions that occur within the collaboration, this study utilized a design tensions framework (Tatar, 2007) toguide data analysis. A design tensions framework, fundamentally, posits that “design exists because of thetension between what is and what ought to be” (Tatar, 2007, p.415). Tensions become the source of designdecisions or choice points; design becomes no longer about solving problems but about goal balancing andseeking optimal compromises within the system (Tatar, 2007). Such an approach allows for more designpossibilities because it transcends the rigid solution choices that typify a design space and instead seeksunbounded, crosscutting design possibilities to create a solution space of greater flexibility (Tatar, 2007). Withinthis study, a design tensions framework affords maneuverability and guidance in understanding and addressingdesign tensions at multiple levels. In addition, making design tensions explicit facilitates conversations amongparticipants about diverse perspectives on design and whether these different perspectives are being adequatelytaken up in deliberations.Design tensions can occur at four different levels. The highest level of tension, vision, describes thestate of an incongruity between “what is and what ought to be” (Tatar, 2007, p.417), which underscores the factthat design is a goal-driven, value-laden enterprise. The tension found on the next level, approach, centers onbringing the values that make up the vision of what “ought to be” into the current state of reality (Tatar, 2007).ICLS 2014 Proceedings1172© ISLSHere, much recursive design work occurs since participants have the volition to choose and alter approaches toaddress design tensions (Tatar, 2007). Below approach, we find the project tensions associated with the actualdecisions of implementation to enact the approach that either fall under the designers’ influence or have becomea point of contention between participants (Tatar, 2007). Finally, the last design tension, designated “ascreated” situations (Tatar, 2007 p.418), describes the fallout from any course of action taken. In other words,though an action may resolve one tension, new tensions will inevitably result from taking the aforementionedaction.Methodological ApproachesA descriptive case study of dynamics within a single RPP, this study applied an ethnographic approach to datacollection and focused on the interactions among and between members of the research practice partnership.Participants included 11 TDT members, 3 district administrators, and 6 researchers. The authors of the studycollected data from the vantage point of a participant observer during all collaborative design work. Sources ofdata for interactions between and among the groups include observations of 21 regular teleconference and faceto-face meetings, analysis of correspondence that spanned 10 months between groups via e-mail, analysis of 15semi-structured interviews with TDT members, and analysis of various artifacts related to both the meetingsthemselves, such as handouts and agendas, and artifacts related to the district aims of the joint collaboration.SubstantiationThroughout the joint work of the RPP, the participants engaged with all four levels of design tensions put forthby Tatar (2007). Table 1 provides a summary of the different levels of design tensions encountered. How thegroup engaged with these design tensions greatly determined the course and effectiveness of the design process.This study argues for the value of a common vision and design methodology in order to enable design tensionsto become generative influences on design. Below, how each level of design tensions influenced the designprocess within the RPP is discussed.ValuesWithin this collaborative endeavor, the vast majority of participants shared a common understanding of thedesign tension of vision, of “what is and what ought to be,” in regards to the overall telos of the EdTrex project(Tatar, 2007). With few exceptions, participants from all levels of the multi-tier RPP felt a desire to revise thecurrent 9th grade Algebra curriculum. As summarized by a researcher speaking at an early meeting to fellowparticipants, this task called on RPP members to “digitally enhance their curriculum,” to “increase the richnessof mathematical tasks” and “increase student engagement.” A district administrator at the same meeting echoedthis enthusiasm by referring to the EdTrex platform as “the place to go…not just for us but for all of the city.”Generally, the 11 TDT members expressed enthusiasm with doing curricular work during interviews with onlyone practitioner remarking “to be completely honest the curriculum development type of thing is actually theaspect of teaching that I’m least interested in.” This alignment of vision, a shared sense through all levels andgroups in the RPP of what “ought to be,” allowed increased cohesiveness in the direction of design and provideda common touchstone for participants.ApproachIn terms of the design tensions regarding approach, this area too saw much alignment. Though the leadershiptier of the RPP, comprised of the district administrators and researchers, devised the overall framework of howparticipants went about co-design activities within meetings, etc., teachers nonetheless endorsed the generalapproach with one teacher even exclaiming during a meeting, “I’m technically a designer now too, aren’t I?” Asoutlined in the theory of the design tensions framework, this alignment of approach should not prove surprising(Tatar, 2007). Since the values portion of the design tension approach matches with the “ought” portion of thehigher-level vision design tension, and having already established a congruency amongst participants in the RPPin that regard, one would expect similar attitudes from participants regarding the approaches applied.Project TensionsThough numerous project tensions did arise, we will examine only one in detail here (see Table 1 for a list ofother project tensions). Project tensions proved both the most problematic in terms of affecting the cohesivenessof the RPP but also the most useful in terms of framing design choices. With one of the agreed-upon goals ofthe project stipulating that the EdTrex platform scale across the district, much of the design attended to thiseffort. As mentioned previously, design is a value-laden enterprise and participants apply those values inconjunction with their expertise when making design choices.Though participants seemingly all valued the idea of bringing the EdTrex to scale, the decisions ofimplementation to achieve this goal surfaced different, equally valid concerns. The district administrator groupof the RPP adopted a more conservative approach to scaling by gating researcher access to teachers whereasICLS 2014 Proceedings1173© ISLSresearchers desired a more aggressive approach of direct access to teachers at their school site to support scalingand EdTrex. The district administrators’ reasoning seems to stem from their expertise of each school’s uniquesituation, demonstrated through their impressive knowledge of the personnel at each site on more than oneoccasion, and a likely concern for teacher autonomy as reflected in their rebuffing of an offer from theresearchers to assist with a new teacher training, saying in an e-mail the teachers “are fine with handling thisintroduction to EdTrex for the new Algebra 1 teachers themselves.”In keeping with the tenets of a design tensions framework, participants navigated this tension aroundscaling by attempting to balance the goals of participants to reach an optimal compromise (Tatar, 2007).Recognizing a need of teachers for supporting the implementation of tasks along certain dimensions,particularly language supports for emerging bilingual students, the leadership tier of the RPP realized that theEdTrex could be the “delivery vehicle” to provide teachers across the district with the instructional supportsthey need. Proposing that TDT teachers could broker the distribution of materials, one district administratorstated during a meeting, “[W]e’ll focus on where we have a TDT member to do that and then where we don’thave a TDT member…” “Try to get one,” completed a researcher. Scaling the EdTrex more quickly nowseemed more desirable. Even though researchers did not gain direct access to teachers, they still seemedagreeable to the compromise since in the words of one researcher during the same meeting, “More TDT teacherswould help to spread the work load,” and, according to another researcher “in some of these schools it’s kind offuzzy to see how things operate, but as we learn more about it then hopefully that will help our scaling issue.”Current plans are for the RPP to co-design professional development task support modules that TDT memberscan share with their colleagues at their sites.“As Created” SituationsAs predicted by the theory of the design tensions framework, the enactment of approaches to alleviate designtensions in turn created new tensions falling into the category of “as created” situations (Tatar, 2007). Similarto the previous section regarding project tensions, numerous “as created” situation tensions surfaced in analysisof the data. The most prominent will receive discussion here (see Table 1 for a list of other “as created” situationdesign tensions). From interview and survey data, clearly, the approach conceived of by the leadership tier ofthe RPP placed a large time burden on members of the TDT. When asked, “What challenges did you face inparticipating in EdTrex?” fully seven of the nine teachers who answered this survey item referred to “time”being an issue. Specifically, one teacher responded, “Finding the time to analyze and go through the tasks on topof my current load of work.” Undoubtedly, attempts to remedy this situation will lead to the creation of a newdesign tension. Perhaps, however, an optimal compromise agreeable to all participants of the RPP can beachieved (Tatar, 2007).Table 1: Design tensions within the EdTrex RPPVisionIs: Current Algebra curriculum doesnot align to the CCSS-M and has tasksof low qualityOught: Revised Algebra curriculum hashigh-quality mathematical tasks aligned tothe CCSS-M; wide adoption; sustainableApproachProject Drivers: Co-design of digitalplatform, selection and rating of tasks,implementation of tasks in classroomValues: Rigorous curriculum, equitabledesign partnership, high utility of toolProject TensionsTension 1Gated Access to Practitioners vs. DirectAccess to PractitionersPractice Tasks vs. High CognitiveDemand TasksTeacher Pace on Scope & Sequence vs.District GuidelinesTension 2Tension 3“As created” SituationsHigh demands on teacher time; teachers disagreeing with EdTrex content andleaving RPP; too few tasks in some areas of EdTrexConclusionThis study examined the design process of a multi-tiered, tripartite RPP by collecting data using a participantobserver ethnographic approach and analyzing data through the theoretical lens of a design tensions framework(Tatar, 2007). Central to the contribution of this study is an enhanced understanding of the practice of design,particularly in relation to the unique multi-tiered structure of the RPP. This study highlighted the importance ofICLS 2014 Proceedings1174© ISLSparticipants at all levels of a multi-tiered RPP sharing a common understanding of the vision design tension. Asmentioned previously, a common vision within this framework posits that the approach design tension shall alsodemonstrate congruency amongst participants. Within this multi-tiered RPP, such alignment allowedparticipants to leverage their expertise synergistically in designing the EdTrex platform and avoided devolvinginto directionless design. Additionally, having a shared understanding amongst participants at the highest levelsof the design tensions hierarchy supported the navigation of design tensions found at the project tensions levelas participants engaged in balancing the goals of members of the RPP towards an optimal compromise.Additionally, analysis in this study suggests potential mechanisms for learning scientists and designresearchers to consider in terms of to how the structure of a multi-tiered, tripartite RPP can support effective codesign. In the interweaving multi-tiered participation model examined, the intentional allowance for interactionbetween different participant groups within different tiers in the RPP increased the likelihood of surfacing moredesign tensions and revealed areas for the RPP to jointly attend to across multiple participant groups. The designtensions served as opportunities for participants to make potentially productive design decisions since thetensions themselves represented needs to be addressed in the design of a co-designed object. In sum, thissuggests that fostering interaction between participant groups within different tiers can lead to more unearthingof design tensions (particularly at the “as created” situations level), which in turn leads to more possibleopportunities to engage in potentially productive design decisions across multiple levels. Therefore, thepossibility that multi-tiered participation structures are more generative in terms of pushing design than otherstructures seems a plausible avenue worthy of further exploration.Lastly, while bringing together groups of participants with differing expertise into a horizontalarrangement, as found in a multi-tiered RPP, may increase the likelihood of a lack of cohesiveness in sharedunderstandings of design tensions, it can also allow for more maneuverability in reaching compromises amongstgroups. As illustrated in the project tension around scaling in this study, with more participants—each withdiffering expertise, roles, and needs within a system—more capacity for negotiation of an optimal arrangementdevelops as particular groups’ interests can overlap productively in a complementary manner with others’interests in ways they could not have with less varied participant groups.Relevance to Conference ThemeIn a fundamental manner, this study demonstrates the conference theme of “learning and becoming in practice.”Indeed, a research practice partnership (RPP) epitomizes the notion of applying what is learned—either at thelevel of the learning researcher or at the level of the learning practitioner but more likely all of the above—towards the creation of a co-designed object, the express purpose of which is to positively impact the realm ofpractice at multiple levels. The inclusive nature of a multi-tiered RPP serves as an exemplar of how the practiceof learning research can intersect with the practice of others, bettering all involved.ReferencesCollins, A., Joseph, D., & Bielaczyc, K.
