In this research, we studied fifthgraders’ emotional engagement in elementary science classes redesigned to offer moreambitious, agentive learning. We examined student self-reports of affective states to addressthe following questions: (1) Do students in “Agency” classes report more positive or negativeemotional experiences, compared to students in classes that use traditional, kit-based scienceunits? (2) To what extent do students’ emotional experiences vary as a function of class?Findings indicate that, after taking classroom differences into account, students in Agencyclasses generally felt more positive about their experiences in science than students in kitbased classes. Next steps include exploring differences across classrooms and synthesizingresearch on learning, affect and identity.BackgroundSince 2006, we have been engaged in design-based implementation research (Penuel, Fishman, Cheng &Sabelli, 2011) on a model of “agentive” science learning to advance students’ science inquiry learning, socialemotional outcomes, and practice-linked identities. Our work involves adapting hands-on science kits in waysthat offer greater student agency: Students are provided with the opportunity to direct their own inquiry on acomplex problem over a sustained period of time, thereby broadening the range of investigative practices inwhich they engage, helping build knowledge by connecting experiences across time and place, in and out ofschool (NRC, 2009) and offering opportunities for original thought (Metz, 2000; Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2009;Herrenkohl & Mertl, 2011). Per Engle and Conant (2002), we encourage students “to be authors and producersof knowledge with ownership over it rather than the mere consumers of it, and [encourage] teachers and othermembers of the learning community to position students as stakeholders by publicly identifying them with theclaims, approaches, explanations, designs, and other responses to problems that they pursue” (p. 404).Our redesigned science kits are challenge-based (Schwartz, Lin, Brophy, & Bransford, 1999): Eachredesigned unit 1) has an overarching challenge (problem) that connects unit lessons; 2) links to students out-ofschool science practices and experiences using student self-documentation; 3) offers sustained, in-depth study ofscience concepts/practices in the context of the overarching problem; 4) involves student-guided inquiry (withteacher scaffolding), and; 5) culminates in a public performance and “call to action” on a local science-relatedissue. The investigative practices that we embed in these units encompass many of the NGSS practices; forexample, students generate their own investigative questions, design investigations to address these questions,engage in argumentation from evidence, construct explanations and used data from investigations to solveproblems.Theoretical Framework and Significance of the WorkResearch suggests that providing students with greater agency to wrestle with science questions and problemscan benefit learning (e.g., NRC, 2000). Additionally, metacognitive benefits may accrue as students monitor andreflect on their knowledge and progress in the context of solving problems about which they care (Brown, 1978;Herrenkohl, et al., 1999), and if learners are appropriately scaffolded in their efforts (White & Frederiksen,1998).Emotional Engagement in LearningIn addition to learning and metacognition, we speculate that there may also be important social-emotionalbenefits of agentive learning. As students engage in these ambitious intellectual activities, they inevitablymanage social interactions and emotional responses in the classroom. Students may develop skills such asmotivation, grit and persistence, adaptability and communication, self-concept and identification as sciencelearners, social belonging, and self-regulation together with their conceptual and epistemological skills. Recenteconomic studies suggest that these social-emotional skills play an important role in long-term social andeconomic success related to schooling and career choices, employment, and wages (e.g., Heckman, Stixrud, &Krzua, 2006).Several learning sciences researchers have begun over the past decade to theorize about the connectionsbetween social emotional constructs, such as identity, and learning (Herrenkohl & Mertl, 2011; Nasir, Lee,ICLS 2014 Proceedings1152© ISLSRoseberry & Warren, 2006; Engle et al, 2008; Esmonde & Langer-Osuna, 2007; Gresalfi, 2009). Some havecoined terms like “intellective identities” (Greeno, 2002) to emphasize how students’ sense of competenceintersects with their conceptual and epistemological abilities.Building on interpretations of Spiro (1982) and Dreyfus (1984), Holland{ XE "Holland" }, Lachicotte{XE "Lachicotte" }, Skinner, & Cain (1998) examined how expertise and interest develops together in a nonscientific domain. Holland et al.’s study of young women’s approaches to romance demonstrated that “salience,identification, and savoir faire appeared to develop together in an interrelated process – a process that wascontinually supported and shaped in the context of social interaction{ XE "social interaction" }” (p.116). Inother words, as women developed greater competence in navigating the romantic scene, their evaluation of theimportance of romantic pursuits, their emotional{ XE "emotional" } investment in this activity, and their desireto continue intensified. Holland and her colleagues suggest that positive emotional engagement and expertisefunction as a system, with one supporting the development of the other. This theoretical stance suggests that thedevelopment of expertise in scientific inquiry is inextricably linked to the development of interest and themanagement of positive emotional responses that support students to seek out further opportunities to engage inscientific practices.Although these aspects of interest and emotional response are theoretically supported, there is verylittle empirical data available to examine these relationships. In the present study the relationship of studentagency and affect in science is explored. This paper derives from a larger comparative research study conductedin the 2012-13 school year in which three 5th grade Full Option Science System (FOSS) science units(representing a school year long intervention) were redesigned to offer students greater agency for theirlearning. Outcomes, in the present case affective outcomes, were then compared to outcomes for studentsparticipating in the original FOSS units. The study addresses the following two questions: (1) Do students in theredesigned Agency unit report more positive or negative affect, compared to students taking the FOSS unit? (2)To what extent do these emotional experiences vary with the units if classroom effects are taken into account?MethodParticipantsParticipants were from an urban/suburban school district in the Pacific Northwest that serves approximately18,000 students. We collaborated with teachers from several elementary schools in the district to study theeffects of the redesigned science units (Agency units), as compared to FOSS’ kit-based units.The participants in this study were 180 fifth grade students from 5 Agency classes across 2 schools,with 21 to 24 students per class (n=113) and 3 FOSS classes across 2 other schools, with 21 to 24 students perclass, (n=67). The percentages of Free and Reduced Lunch students were 44% and 25% for the schools with theAgency classes, and 37% and 46% for the schools with the FOSS classes. The percentages of students receivingELL services were 20% and 37% for schools with the Agency classes, and 16% and 29% for schools with theFOSS classes. The Agency classes were taught by two teachers, one of whom (a Science Specialist) taught fourclasses at one of the schools. The FOSS classes were taught by different teachers.MeasuresTo measure students’ affect related to their experiences in science, students were periodically asked to completean Exit Card (EC) at the end of science class. It contained 10 adjectives: Excited, Frustrated, Challenged in aGood Way, Interested, Bored, Confused, Confident, Helpful, Like a Scientist and Creative. Students were askedto circle all adjectives that described how they felt today in science class. The EC took students 1-2 minutes tocomplete.ProcedureThe findings reported here are based on data collected in January-March 2013 comparing a traditional, kitbased, 5th grade FOSS Landforms earth science unit, and one of our redesigned units. In the redesigned versionof the FOSS Landforms unit, My Skokomish River Challenge (MSRC), students used stream tables to study theimpact of various factors on erosion. The generation of empirically testable questions was completed as awhole-class activity. This is followed by three investigation cycles in which students work collaboratively insmall groups to select a question, design and conduct an experiment to answer that question, analyze data, andshare their findings. Their findings inform their response to the unit challenge – determining which of threeconstruction sites should be chosen in order to cause as few problems due to erosion as possible. Although thepurpose for selecting the sites was hypothetical, the sites themselves were real places within driving distance ofthe schools.Agency students completed Exit Cards 7 times distributed over the course of the 12-week redesignedLandforms unit; FOSS students completed Exit Cards on 6 occasions. Teachers administered the EC to students;however, students’ responses were anonymous to their teachers. Students “signed” their ECs with unique codesICLS 2014 Proceedings1153© ISLSthat only the research team was able to link with their names/identities.AnalysisPrincipal components analysis with varimax rotation was used to calculate two component scores (those witheigenvalues greater than 1) based on the exit card ratings. Hierarchical linear models (HLM) were then used tostudy the effect of the unit intervention on component scores based on the exit card data, since the ratings bystudents were nested within classrooms.ResultsConstruct DevelopmentTable 1 provides the descriptive statistics of the exit card scores for the overall study sample (n=180). Thehighest mean score is for the Interest item (Mean=.76), followed by Excitement and Confidence (Mean=.63 and.55 accordingly). The lowest mean scores is for Frustration (Mean=.10), followed by Confusion and Boredom(Mean=.13 and .15, accordingly). Coherence of the exit card measure set is further supported by the strength ofthe inter-correlations among the individual exit card measures--most variables significantly correlated at the .01level.Table 1: Intercorrelations between exit card measuresMean SDCorrelation (r)Exit cardmeasures11.

Component 1 may be conceptualized as positivevalence feelings, and includes the items Excited, Challenged in a Good Way, Interested, Confident, Helpful,Like a Scientist, and Creative. Component 2 may be conceptualized as negative-valence feelings, and includesthe items Frustrated, Bored, and Confused. (Although the learning process may be accompanied by occasionalfrustration, confusion, or boredom, if too many students in a class feel this way too often, or to a greater extent,this might adversely impact the learning experience over time.) Since the component analysis results found 2factors: positive and negative domains of feeling, we used each factor as an outcome variable to check whetherthe student-reported feelings varied significantly depending on unit as well as classroom.Comparisons Across Units and ClassroomsFinally, HLMs were used to determine whether the differences in component scores were predicted by the unitintervention or not. For this analysis, the exit card component scores were the outcome/dependent variables, andthe intervention was the independent variable in level 2. The data analysis involved first modeling the dependentvariables of positive or negative feelings across classrooms; this constituted Model I. Model II comprised ModelI plus the intervention type (see Table 2).According to the results, the variance of classroom means in Model I for the positive feelingcomponent is significant at .01 level (χ2= 22.89, p < .01). This indicates that the positive feelings of studentswere different among classrooms, with about 9.09% of the variance explained by classroom effects. After takingthe treatment (unit intervention) into considerations in Model II, the treatment effect was significant at the .05level, indicating that the positive feelings of students were significantly higher in the Agency classrooms(Mean=.61), than in the FOSS classrooms (Mean=.47). With regard to the negative feelings component, inICLS 2014 Proceedings1154© ISLSModel II, the treatment effect was not significant, indicating that the negative feelings of students were notsignificantly different between Agency (Mean=.12) and FOSS classrooms (Mean=.14).Table 2: Estimated effects of intervention level on positive and negative feelingModel IPositive feelingFixed EffectIntercept, γ00InterventionRandom EffectInterceptInterventionNegative feelingFixed EffectIntercept, γ00InterventionRandom EffectInterceptInterventionModel IICoefficient0.558665t-ratio15.409**Variance0.007280.07277χ222.88838**Coefficient0.127254t-ratio10.316**Variance0.000000.02736χ24.40228Coefficient0.4694650.142309Variance0.002720.07278t-ratio10.513**2.523*χ211.03637Coefficient0.143120-0.025273Variance0.000000.02736t-ratio7.078**-0.990χ23.41998* p< .05, ** p< .01DiscussionConclusionsThe exit card measures cluster into two components (based on their co-occurrences): positive-valence feelings(Excited, Interested, etc,) and negative-valence feelings (Frustrated, Bored, and Confused). A treatment(Agency/FOSS) effect was found for the positive feelings component, indicating that students in Agencyclasses had more positive emotional experiences during science instruction. In addition, although students in theAgency classes tended to report more positive feelings, there were also large classroom-level differences inpositivity.On the other hand, no significant differences between students in the Agency and FOSS classes wereobserved in terms of negative feelings. These findings suggest that classrooms that support student agency andscientific inquiry are more likely to create conditions for positive emotional experiences among the learners.Findings from the exit card analysis are also supported by the analysis of interview data collected fromstudents in the Agency and FOSS classes (Scalone, 2014). The Agency students viewed science as playfulexperimentation. These reasons were coupled with enjoyment, with students proclaiming that they “love”science and that “science is fun” – perceiving science as playful experimentation. In addition, Agency studentsindicated that they like science more than the FOSS students. Their reasons included getting to “learn newthings” and “do experiments.” The Agency students also identified themselves as scientists, signaling theiremotional investment in the doing of science.Implications for Future ResearchThe study discussed here examines one of the five redesigned units developed for Grades 2 and 5. Furtherresearch will focus on examining students’ reports of emotional states across all redesigned and FOSScomparison units. More fine-grained analysis of the exit card data is also under way to better understandstudents’ specific emotional experiences with different units and in different classrooms. In addition, furtheranalyses using the student interview data will allow us to examine the relationship between student report ofemotional states and conceptual and epistemological understanding in science. We also plan to triangulate selfreported affect with videotaped episodes of classroom activities to explore the situative aspects of affective,cognitive, and behavioral engagement during collaborative scientific inquiry, including the role of teachingpractices (e.g., Engle & Conant, 2002; Herrenkohl & Guerra, 1998). Ultimately this body of work can contributeto testing an empirical model that links developing interest and expertise as important parts of a system tosupport science learning.Relevance to Conference ThemeThe theme of ICLS this year highlights a movement over the past decade to increasingly connect to ideas ofbeing and becoming processes that include social emotional dimensions mentioned above. Our research onscience learning addresses principles for developing students’ agency to inquire about personally-relevant,socially-consequential science problems, while also supporting them to cultivate powerful intellectual practicesICLS 2014 Proceedings1155© ISLSand positive attitudes toward science. The analysis presented in this paper connects to these ideas of learning,being and becoming, by highlighting the emotional dimensions that are often left out of empirical studies.ReferencesBereiter, C., & Scardamalia, M.
