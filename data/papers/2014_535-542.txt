It also compares the Learning Scienceswith the closely related academic fields of Educational Technology and EducationalPsychology. A content analysis is performed on 5187 journal articles drawing from 12 topjournals from 2003 to 2012. This content analysis was semi-automated and guided by aninitial theoretical frame. The results reveal that research trends in the Learning Sciences haveremained largely consistent except in the area of individual differences and affect, which hasincreased over the years. Key strengths of Learning Sciences include research on small grouplearning, inquiry, problem solving, argumentation, and mixed-methods. As the LS reflects onits state of practice, it should recognize that the field has achieved many research distinctives,yet, there are several opportunities for further research growth.IntroductionThe field of the Learning Sciences (LS) has evolved and blossomed internationally. It counts over 24 coursesand programs around the world (NAPLeS). Over the past decade, new research topics and themes have emergedin the field including design studies, scaffolding, case-based reasoning, prior knowledge, and metacognition(Kolodner, 2004; Sawyer, 2008). LS researchers have been working closely with educators in schools, exploringnew models of schooling, making explicit learning processes, as well as designing new methodologies andtechnologies to enable enhanced learning. As part of tracing its development and process, and enhancing itsprogress in the future, it is important to step back and reflect on the state of the field. Where are we now? Whathas been the focus of the LS? Are there certain research themes that have been dominating? What are thestrengths and weaknesses of the field?To gain some insight into the research trends of the LS, it is useful to compare it with related fields.The Learning Sciences draws from a wide spectrum of disciplines such as Cognitive Science, EducationalTechnology (ET), Educational Psychology (EP), Computer Science, and Applied Linguistics. The fields of ETand EP share a special bond with the LS as they all emphasize some aspect of learning. ET focuses more on themedium which learning occurs while EP, what occurs within the learner. It would be interesting to knowwhether they are differences between the LS and these two fields. Important distinctions could be drawn fromthe comparison, and theoretical and empirical contributions of the LS made explicit.Moreover, in the field of the LS, there have been limited studies on its research trends. Severalresearchers have provided conceptual viewpoints of the state of the field. For instance, Sawyer (2008)synthesized four findings of LS research: 1) importance of deep conceptual understanding, 2) importance oflearning connected and coherent knowledge, 3) learning authentic knowledge, and 4) collaboration. Besidesconceptual viewpoints and insightful commentary, a useful method to examine the state of the field is throughexamining the corpus of articles published in the field.Past research has examined published research trends through content analysis (Chang, Chang, &Tseng, 2010; Hew, Kale, & Kim, 2007; Hsu et al., 2012; Lee, Wu, & Tsai, 2009). The content analysis isusually conducted by categorizing journal articles in multiple dimensions. This is typically developed on thebasis of literature reviews and/or a preliminary data analysis. For instance, Mitchell and McConnell III (2012)analyzed articles published in Contemporary Educational Psychology from 1995 to 2010 in terms of researchtopics, theoretical perspectives, research participants, and research methods. In addition, Hew, Kale, and Kim(2007) analyzed articles published in three journals related to ET from 2000 to 2004 in terms of research topics,research methods, data collection, and research settings.Besides human content analysis, semi-automatic approaches to content analysis using text analyticsoftware has been shown to be a viable method. These are more reliable than human coding and are relativelytime-efficient (McKenny, Short, & Payne, 2012; Rotgans, 2012; Yu, Jannasch-Pennell, & DiGangi, 2011). Forinstance, Rotgans (2012) used semi-automatic content analysis to examine the trends of 10,168 articles inmedical education research over 23 years. The research showed the viability of this approach and generatedimportant themes useful for widening the scope of medical education research.Through content analysis, we can identify what research topics, methods, research settings etc., aremost frequently used in research articles and how their frequency has changed during a particular time period.For instance, Hew and colleagues (2007) found that articles about media study (41%) and psychology oflearning (41%) are most frequently published in three ET journals from 2000 and 2004. Lee et al. (2009) foundICLS 2014 Proceedings535© ISLSthat articles about student learning contexts were more published in three science education journals during2003-2007 than during 1998-2002. Similarly, Rotgans (2012) found that there has been an increase in articles oncommunication skills training, clinical reasoning, faculty development, use of simulations, and studentcharacteristics in six medical education journals from 1988 to 2010.Towards gaining a better understanding of the field of the Learning Sciences, this research asks, whatare the trends in LS over 10 years from 2003 to 2012? Secondly, how do these trends in LS differ from those inET and EP? A research trend is the general direction that a field is heading towards. Trends will be identified bycontent analysis. A content analysis is performed on a dataset drawing from 12 top journals from 2003 to 2012.The quantity of articles that represent the research subtheme provides indication of the trends. This contentanalysis was semi-automated and guided by an initial theoretical frame of themes used in past research. Thenext section describes the methodology followed by the description of the results. A discussion of the findings iselaborated on and then integrated towards the end of the paper.MethodData SourceJournal article data from 2003 to 2012 was obtained from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. Weselected four journals from each of the academic fields, LS, EP, ET. The twelve journals (refer to Table 1) arethe journals with the highest impact factor in the three fields. We collected bibliometric information fromoriginal articles and excluded editorial materials, book and software reviews, and announcements. In total, 5187journal articles were retrieved. Table 1 shows the breakdown of the papers from each journal. The InternationalJournal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning was launched in 2006, although other LS journalsregularly published articles from 2003 to 2007.Table 1: Number of articles from the 12 Journals in the three fieldsFieldLearningSciencesEducationalPsychologyEducationalTechnologyJournal(a) Journal of the Learning Sciences(b) International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning(c) Cognition & Instruction(d) Instructional Science(a) Educational Psychologist(b) Journal of Educational Psychology(c) Learning and Instruction(d) Contemporary Educational Psychology(a) Computers & Education(b) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning(c) British Journal of Educational Technology(d) Educational Technology Research & DevelopmentNo. of papers1401481312901866574102701502417676360Analysis MethodAll article titles, keywords and abstracts of the dataset were extracted and analyzed by semi-automated contentanalysis using the SPSS Text Analysis for Surveys 4.0 software. This software uses advanced linguisticalgorithms to extract and classify key concepts from the text (IBM, 2011). The technology identifies the phrase,sentence and grammatical structures of content based on three main linguistic techniques: term derivation, terminclusion, and semantic networks. Based on pre-defined library rules, keywords and phrases are identified andgrouped under a main concept. These concepts are then grouped into type patterns using semantic networktechniques. For instance, the root concept “scaffolding” included related phrases and patterns such as “writtenscaffolds”, “peer scaffolding”, “computerized scaffolds + supported”, “scaffolding + effective” and “scaffoldingapproaches”.One key advantage is that this technology allows researchers to extract and categorize key conceptsreliably and consistently. It also reduces the time taken to categorize the content. However, human contentanalysis was still performed. Text analysis is an iterative process and extraction results were reviewed by theresearchers according to the context of the text data. Categories were drawn from the data as well as derivedfrom themes of past research. A preliminary data analysis of past content analysis frameworks revealed thefollowing themes in Table 2. Based on this initial framework, relevant extracted concepts were identified. Inaddition, concepts that appeared frequently in the dataset were considered and fine-tuned as themes wherepossible.ICLS 2014 Proceedings536© ISLSTable 2: Initial Content Analysis FrameworkThemesResearch topicsResearch methodsResearch settings(participants)Subthemes(a) Individual differences(b) Learning processes(c) Instructional design and strategy(d) Media study(e) Culture and community(f) Research and evaluation methodology(a) Quantitative(b) Qualitative(c) Mixed-methods(d) Review and meta-analysis(e) Theoretical(a) Laboratory(b) Early childhood education(c) Primary school(d) Secondary school(e) Higher education(f) Informal context(g) Virtual environmentReferenceHew et al.

(2012)Mitchell & McConnell III (2012)In total, from 5187 records, 1775 concepts were extracted. To better answer the two research questionsof this study, we manually refined the software-generated categories by deleting irrelevant keywords, adding innew categories, editing the acceptable ones, and regrouping them. For example, the extracted data showedseveral articles focusing on “parent and family”. We decided to identify this as our subtheme and includedrelevant extracted concepts such as “parent”, “parental involvement”, “father”, and “mother”. After therefinement process, 9 meaningful themes and 62 subthemes (subcategories) resulted. This formed the basis forfurther analysis.From the SPSS Text Analysis for Surveys 4.0 software, a frequency count was generated. This denotesthe number of articles that are classified into the subtheme. Even if an article has more than one extractedconcept classified in that subtheme, it is only counted once. There are no extra counts of the same article in onesubtheme. These larger themes were ordered by frequency from the highest to lowest. The results were thenexported into SPSS Statistics 21 for further statistical analysis. For each subtheme, a series of three-way analysisof variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the paper counts for ET, EP and LS from 2003-2012.Whenever significant ANOVA results were obtained, Scheffe post-hoc test was conducted to compare thedifference in paper counts between pairs of academic fields. To examine the trends over 10 years, we decided touse a ballpark period of 5-years to distinguish between earlier and later years, similar to Hsu et al. (2012). Weconducted a series of t-tests to compare the paper counts for each subtheme of LS between period 1 (2003-2007)and period 2 (2008-2012). This process of refinement and analysis was similar to the steps by Rotgans (2012).Next, we examine the results of how themes changed over time (5-year interval) in the LS as well as how thethemes were represented in the three academic fields.Findings and DiscussionTable 3 below summarizes the results of the content analysis of the titles, keywords and abstracts of 12 journalsfrom 2003-2012. This is ranked starting from the highest frequency count of the themes from the whole dataset.Overall in the 3 fields, many of the articles fall into the theme of research topics, with 8232 articlesexamining a diversity of research topics from media study to work and career. Sociocultural practices such aslearning communities, culture and society are also part of this theme of research topics. Within all thesubthemes, there is a dominant subtheme on media study, with 3242 (62.5%) articles from the dataset. This isnot surprising as various media forms from mobile devices to asynchronous discussion forums have been hottopics over the years in LS, ET and EP. This is similar to the findings by Hew et al. (2007). The subtheme ofstudent in the category stakeholder is the second most examined area. The student being the main stakeholder ineducation research was found in 3108 studies (59.92%). At the tail end, there were fewer studies on principaland leadership among three fields (48 articles). This perhaps is due to the focus on the learner and the student inthese education journals.In the field of the LS, the student stakeholder is a primary focus. There were 478 articles or 67.42% ofLS articles representing the student. Another major subtheme is that of learning, one of the educationalactivities. This was found in 348 (49.08%) articles. Media study was a close third, with 342 articles (48.24%)examining it. As for the tail end, algorithms were hardly examined, as just 1 article was identified. This is notsurprising in LS as the focus is not on computer-related algorithms. Principal & leadership was also less of afocus, with 4 articles (0.56%) about it. This is an area of concern as school leaders can determine severalICLS 2014 Proceedings537© ISLSsociocultural practices in schools. In addition, society was a research topic that was hardly emphasized in LSwith only 6 identified articles (0.85%). This is a surprising find as society provides a key context in the designand practice of learning. These infrequently covered subthemes highlight possible gaps in LS research.Table 3: Result of the content analysis of the titles, keywords and abstracts of 12 journals from 2003-2012Themes andsubthemesComparison within LSaLSLS2003-20072008-2012(n=268)(n=441)1.

The data revealed 2significant differences in subthemes over the 2 stages. Development of the field of the LS over the 2 stagesshows an emphasis on individual differences such as gender, learning styles, and age. As seen from Figure 1,there is a sharp increase of individual differences research compared to those of evaluation and learningstrategies among the research topics. This suggests the recognition in the LS to examine sociocultural and largercontextual factors that affect learning.Another finding is regarding affect, which examines feelings, moods, and emotions. This isincreasingly focused on in the later years of LS. This suggests a broadening in the LS towards the understandingof the domains of learning. As illustrated in Figure 2, cognitive and psychomotor (skill) aspects are stillfrequently studied in the LS as compared to affect. However, the field has recognized the importance of thesocioemotional aspects of learning too. We note that there seems to be a slight dip in the cognitive aspects oflearning and this research area could be reaching a saturation point.Nevertheless, the number of articles focusing on particular themes has been steadily increasing over theyears. It suggests that, the LS as a field, is sticking to its roots. The next section helps us understand the LSresearch trends in relation to the closely related fields of EP and ET.Figure 1. Trends in research topicsICLS 2014 ProceedingsFigure 2. Domains of learning: affect, skill andcognitive539© ISLSHow Does LS Research Differ from EP and ET Research?The results reveal many significant differences between LS, EP and ET. These differences highlight thestrengths and weaknesses of each field. We examine the research topic first. Interestingly, the findings revealthat the LS does not dominate any particular research topic. The LS is similar to ET but stronger than EP interms of learning outcomes, learning communities, curriculum, and learning processes. Focusing on learningend goals, being in learning communities of practice, designing the curriculum, and understanding processes oflearning all suggest that the LS concerns itself very much in the practice of learning.As for domains of learning, LS has focused more on knowledge, cognitive, and metacognitive aspectsas compared to ET but similar to EP. In the LS, there is a clear emphasis on knowledge as seen from the manystudies on knowledge building, knowledge creation and even knowledge transfer. As for cognitive andmetacognitive aspects, these acknowledge LS’s close ties with the Cognitive Sciences. It highlights the depth towhich the LS explores learning, making visible thinking about thinking.The LS holds students as their chief stakeholders, much more than the other 2 fields. Learningscientists seem to place importance on their students for it is them who are performing the learning. LS alsoemphasizes on teachers more than EP but similar to ET. This could be due to the tight interplay betweenteaching and learning in LS. What and how teachers teach affects how students learn. In ET teachers areimportant stakeholders too as they have certain control over the technologies that students use. LS and EPgenerally tend to emphasize naturalistic settings, where the classroom or course is the research setting and theteacher and student are the participants. However in EP, there is less emphasis on students and teachers ascompared to the other fields possibly owing to their focus on laboratory testing with experiment subjects.For educational activities, LS’s strength is in learning and teaching but not assessing. There are agreater proportion of articles in LS on learning and teaching compared to EP as shown in Figure 3. Thishighlights the strong tradition in LS on these activities that directly contribute to enhancement of learning.Assessing is less emphasized in LS and suggests research opportunities in this area. Assessing is stronger in ETpossibly due to the design and development of electronic forms of assessment.In research setting, the LS has emphasized research on informal contexts and virtual environment ascompared to EP. This is similar to ET. These highlights the many sociocultural understandings of learning, thatit is not limited to the formal environment but to the informal and virtual contexts. Moreover, technologicaltools help to advance learning in these research settings. Interestingly, the other two fields have a largerproportion of articles on primary school research settings as compared to LS. EP also dominates the other twofields in early childhood settings suggesting a de-emphasis in the LS on these research participants.In the 9th category, age of learner, a similar pattern emerges as EP dominates LS in terms of childrenand teenagers. It is possible that EP researchers with expertise in developmental psychology have carried outmore research about individual differences in the development of children when compared to LS researchers.This suggests a gap in LS research for younger learners and LS researchers could delve into this area. As forpedagogical strategies, the LS shows its dominance in many different strategies: collaboration, small grouplearning, inquiry, problem solving, argumentation, and scaffolding. As can be expected, collaboration is a keyFigure 3. Educational activities among the three fieldsfocus in the LS. A journal on collaborative learning was specially launched. Similarly, the focus on small grouplearning is seen in LS compared to the other 2 fields. The inquiry approach is also a key strength of LS research.ICLS 2014 Proceedings540© ISLSThe LS focuses much more on inquiry compared to ET or EP. This particular pedagogy systematizes howstudents discover and retrieve information. Entire curriculums have been developed around such pedagogies.Problem solving, in particular real-world problem solving is another hallmark of the LS. Manycurricular tasks are designed with problem solving as the basis to encourage students’ reasoning,communication, and explanation skills. Many learning interventions in LS are centered on such problem-basedlearning approaches. Argumentation too has been clearly articulated in the LS with many LS scholarssynthesizing the many steps and processes of such pedagogy. Another key strength of the LS is the subthemescaffolding. The LS has a strong foundation of work on scaffolding compared to the other two fields. There havebeen many different theoretical developments of scaffolds from metacognitive ones to fading scaffolds and thispedagogical strategy has certainly contributed theoretically and practically to the field (McNeill, Lizotte,Krajcik, & Marx, 2006).In terms of research method, qualitative and mixed-methods are more dominant in LS compared to EPand ET. This reinforces the field’s desire for richness in insights and in-the-field design interventions. However,further opportunities exist for reviews and meta-analysis, which seems to be stronger in EP.As for epistemic disciplines, science is the dominant discipline in LS. Mathematics is also emphasizedmore in LS compared to ET. However, language research is still a particular focus of EP as compared to LS.This could be an area that more LS researchers could go into.Concluding RemarksWhere are we now? This paper has revealed data-driven research trends in LS over 10 years, as well as incomparison with ET and EP. The LS in these 10 years has remained rather consistent in research focus. Still,there is evidence of incremental changes in research themes, particularly in individual differences and affect.The increasing focus on affect is similar to the trend in science education research (Lee et al. 2009) whichlooked at the affective dimensions of science learning. It is also surprising that subthemes related tosociocultural practices have not increased significantly across the stages. Although many LS researchers agreethat novel pedagogical strategies should be investigated in real contexts, it is hard to examine the roles ofsociocultural factors in learning and teaching practices as well as learning outcomes. More LS research shouldexplore dynamic interactions between individual learning activities and sociocultural characteristics of acommunity and develop new learning theories.The comparison of LS with ET and EP reveals several distinctions of the LS. The LS has cleardistinctives in the student as learner, pedagogical strategies: collaboration, small group learning, inquiry,problem solving, argumentation, and scaffolding. These lines of research should be continuously studied andcapitalized on. Our data also reveals the dominance of LS in the epistemic discipline of science. As compared toEP, the LS has a greater emphasis on the research topics: learning outcomes, learning communities, curriculum,and learning processes and has focused on educational activities learning and teaching in informal contexts andvirtual environments. As compared to ET, the LS is more dominant in the learning domains knowledge,cognition and metacognition and the epistemic discipline mathematics. Other strengths of the LS include itsmethodologies in qualitative and mixed-methods. It is important that LS as a new research field has uniquetopics, concepts, and theories, which are distinguishable from EP and ET.We believe that there are areas for growth in LS. Research on assessment is an area of growth and thereare some past LS research that has examined assessment for deeper understanding (Sawyer, 2008). Anothertopic that LS could focus on relates to societal aspects. Past LS has been very much classroom-based, butecological and systemic perspectives could enlighten how LS work can be seen in a broader lens, and wouldhave further implications at policy and societal levels. As mentioned, LS has been increasing in affect researchover the 10 years. This is a good sign, as compared to the other 2 fields, LS still lacks behind them. Greateremphasis of the affective aspects of learning would be fruitful for a holistic understanding of the learner.Moreover, LS researchers might want to diversify from science and mathematics epistemic disciplines toexplore languages. Lastly, the LS should also place greater emphasis on younger learners such as those in earlychildhood education to allow for a more developmental understanding of the learner.This research is not without its flaws. The findings reflect only 10 years of the selected journal articles,and may not be an extensive gauge of research trends. Another limitation relates to the method where articlesare classified based on extracted concepts through pre-defined rules. Articles could have been classified intoonly 1 category. Similarly, this method did not allow for articles to be coded for each research theme. Tomitigate this, the authors examined articles which fell into only one category and identified further concepts orpatterns to classify it into other subthemes. Lastly, the themes and subthemes identified in the study weredependent on the extraction process. If certain keywords were not present, it was difficult for the software torecognize it. This posed difficulties when the authors wanted to examine less common trends such as “scalingand translation” and this was removed from the final subthemes. Another problem arose for overly frequentlywords such as “design”. For instance, many abstracts used phrases such as “in the design of the study”. Due tothe lack of sophistication in the rules of extraction, these articles were also categorized into the subthemeICLS 2014 Proceedings541© ISLS“design studies”. As there were too many non-relevant articles included in this subtheme, the authors had toremove it in view of having more accurate subthemes. We acknowledge that these categorizations can be furtherrefined. Nevertheless, the existing themes and subthemes do reveal important findings of the state of LSresearch.LS has its key strengths in research ranging from small group learning, inquiry, problem solving,argumentation to qualitative and mixed-methods. These strengths can be further capitalized on and deepened.This paper has also identified research trends that could be further examined such as assessing and affect. Inaddition, this study’s methodology has showcased a reliable and relatively time efficient method of contentanalysis which can be further built upon. As the LS reflects on its state of practice, it should recognize that thefield has achieved many research distinctives, yet, there are several opportunities for further research growth.ReferencesChang, Y.-H., Chang, C.-Y., & Tseng, Y.-H.
