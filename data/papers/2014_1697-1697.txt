Interaction Analysis of Student Teams Enacting the Practices ofCollaborative Dynamic GeometryGerry Stahl, Drexel UniversityAbstract: Analyze evidence of mathematical learning in a CSCL approach. Makecollaborative learning, group cognition and formation of team practices visible in thediscourse. Conduct fine-grained interaction analysis of logs across a sequence of chat sessionsusing the Virtual Math Teams collaboration environment incorporating multi-user dynamicgeometry software. Analyze changes in the student team’s ability to engage in collaboration,software usage, geometry construction, problem solving, mathematical reasoning, design ofgeometric dependency and creative exploration – underlying practices of collaborativedynamic geometry. Join researchers and experienced interaction analysts to discuss data fromthislong-termdesign-based-researchCSCLeffort.Detailsandmaterials:http://gerrystahl.net/vmt/icls2014.
