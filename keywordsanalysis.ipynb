       "'Keywords: equity, justice, mathematics education, whiteness\\n\\nMathematics education as a white institutional space\\n\\nEquity has been an important, long-standing goal in mathematics education. Although efforts toward equity and\\njustice in mathematics education through research and teacher education are making an impact on the field, this\\nwork remains situated within broader systems of privilege and oppression that support and constrain these\\nefforts in various ways. In 2008, mathematics education researcher Danny Martin called on stakeholders in\\nmathematics education research and policy to recognize the field as largely a white institutional space. Feagin\\nand Moore (as cited in Martin, 2008) characterize white institutional space as ideologies and practices in a\\ncontext, framed as “neutral” or “fair,” that serve to maintain white supremacy. In this characterization, white\\nprivilege is maintained through mundane, transparent practices that operate (often) beyond the conscious\\nattention of the individual actors involved in the activity. This view of white institutional space couples well\\nwith racialized conceptualizations of Vygotsky’s (1978) zone of proximal development (Leonardo & Manning,\\n2017). As mathematics education scholars committed to equity and social justice, we take up this call to closely\\nexamine the ways in which our project space maintained white institutional space. We recognize that, as\\nLeonardo (2004) argues, whiteness saturates everyday school life (and also our project work) and that one of the\\nfirst steps to articulating its features is coming to terms with its specific modes of discourse. We must\\nunderstand whether and how whiteness is operating in order to transgress existing boundaries and engage in\\nexplicit work to disrupt its function.\\n\\nDiscursive practices of whiteness\\n\\nThis paper focuses on work that is part of the Access, Agency, and Allies in Mathematical Systems (A3IMS)\\nproject, in which our project team set out to design and study a mathematics teacher professional development\\n(PD) that explicitly attended to access, agency, and ally work as embedded components of equitable\\nmathematical systems that support students’ and teachers’ opportunities to learn. This paper examines\\nmechanisms through which some white researchers on our racially diverse project team instantiated and\\nsustained an institutional space of whiteness through their discursive activity despite the expressed goal of all\\nproject team members to interrupt sociopolitical injustice in mathematics education. This paper, then, speaks to\\nthe question of how mathematics educators committed to equity and justice still perpetuate whiteness in their\\nwork and, thus, require additional, targeted efforts toward the continued dismantling of oppressive structures.\\nLike Battey and Leyva (2016), we hope not just to name white privilege but to “document the institutional ways\\nin which [w]hite supremacy in mathematics education acts to reproduce subordination and advantage” (p. 51).\\nSpecifically, this paper presents empirical examples, drawn from a particular conversation about the original\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n1141\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\nplans for part of the PD by the racially diverse research team, to illuminate how whiteness was instantiated and\\nmaintained as an overarching frame of the interactions taking place.\\n\\nTheoretical and methodological approach\\n\\nHere we draw on a range of literature from outside and within mathematics education to introduce and describe\\nthe key constructs that inform this study: race and racism, whiteness, white supremacy, white privilege, white\\ninstitutional space, and white zones of proximal development.\\nOur project team has been comprised of 16 scholars at various times, in different stages of careers and\\nwith multiple areas of expertise. The five principal investigators on the research project were white. The\\nscholars of color on the bigger project team were early in their careers and not yet tenured or were doctoral\\nstudents. Yet, all of the project team had teaching experience and various expertise related to the PD design. The\\nPD design team was made up of three white principal investigators, two white senior personnel, one African\\nAmerican and one white graduate student, and participation on this team was voluntary. It is important to note\\nthat although there is a danger in focusing solely on a single dimension of team members’ identities (see, for\\nexample, Bullock, 2017), we believe strongly that a focus on race helps to illuminate longstanding racial\\ninjustice in the U.S. and in mathematics education. We also acknowledge “choosing” a racialized term to signify\\none’s racial identity can be difficult, in part because this identity may not be consistent across contexts and the\\nways in which race intersects other socially-constructed concepts (e.g., ethnicity, nationality). Here we use race\\nand professional status to illustrate the complexity of tensions present in white institutional spaces reified\\nthrough of white zones of proximal development.\\nAcross several contributions, Martin has referred to mathematics education and research contexts as\\nwhite institutional spaces (e.g. 2008; 2013). To define white institutional space, Martin tied his early work to\\nMoore (as cited in Martin, 2008, p. 27) to characterize four foundational elements around exclusion, framing,\\nhistorical construction, and the assertion of neutrality. Martin (2008) argues that even “well-intentioned\\nindividual whites” have benefitted from the historical constructions of race that have produced and reproduced\\nboundaries between whiteness and non-whiteness to create racial hierarchies to reward those who are socially\\nconstructed as white. Martin continued by adding that structural and institutional perpetuations of whiteness and\\nwhite privilege also help to maintain white institutional space (p. 390). Given the presence of whiteness and\\nwhite privilege within mathematics education, there is motive to view mathematics education and researchbased work related to mathematics education as white institutional spaces.\\nMartin (2013) adapted his earlier definition of white institutional spaces to apply it to the context of\\nmathematics education, characterized by (a) numerical domination by whites and the exclusion of people of\\ncolor from positions of power, (b) the development of a white frame, (c) the historical construction of curricular\\nmodels based on white thought, and (d) the assertion of knowledge production as neutral and unconnected to\\npower relations (p. 323). Martin’s characterization of mathematics education as white institutional space has\\ninfluenced further investigation into areas mathematics education informed (e.g. Battey & Leyva, 2016; Stinson,\\n2017). Stinson (2017) argued that researching race in mathematics education without researching white\\nsupremacy in mathematics education is a strategic discursive practice and supports Martin’s (2013) use of white\\ninstitutional space and the encouragement to question the type of project and the interests being served by the\\nproject of mathematics education. Battey and Leyva (2016) stressed the importance of naming white\\ninstitutional spaces, including their mechanisms of oppression, to provide those in the field of mathematics\\neducation ideas for combatting racist structures (p. 49). We aim to shed light on one particular white\\ninstitutional space in order to share specific encounters with whiteness to support growth toward resisting\\nstructures of racism within the field of mathematics education.\\nWithin the instantiation of white institutional space one mechanism for maintaining whiteness is what\\nLeonardo and Manning (2017) call a white zone of proximal development that works against learning to\\nadvance the actual development of white people and maintains a white zone of proximal underdevelopment (p.\\n24). This application of whiteness extends Vygotsky’s (1978) zone of proximal development, the space where\\nthe development of one person can be extended through the collaboration with a more capable peer via\\nmeditational tools. In this paper, speech, race, and professional status all are potential meditational tools.\\nTherefore, we focus our analysis on discourse processes that mediated the goals of diverse team of PD designers\\nand illustrate the complex interplay between racialized professional identities.\\nOne transcript of a project team meeting was selected for the focus of this paper, since the topics\\ndiscussed dealt explicitly with issues of whiteness. The interaction in this transcript took place at a whole group\\nmeeting in May 2016 during the second year of the project work, two months before the first week-long PD\\nwith the teachers occurred. This segment of the meeting was meant to allow team members of the research\\nproject who did not work directly on the design of the PD to give feedback to those who did.\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n1142\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\nWe used Haviland’s (2008) analytic framework for identifying white educational discourse to analyze\\ndiscourse moves within the transcript that maintained or disrupted whiteness. Drawing on literature from critical\\nwhiteness studies, Haviland identified discursive techniques involved in 1) power-evasion and 2) affirming\\nwhiteness. With this framework, we each independently reviewed the transcript, marking instances of powerevasion, whiteness affirmation, and efforts seemingly aimed at disrupting whiteness occurred. Following\\nmultiple discussions of the discursive moves in the transcript, we jointly identified six key events from within\\nthe longer transcript for further examination. The selection of key events follows the qualitative research\\npractice of choosing excerpts to aid in conceptualization of ideas (Erickson, 1985). The selection of these key\\nevents was not based on its adequacy to support analysis, but rather to help illuminate and interrogate what we\\nconsider to be instances of whiteness in this particular space.\\n\\nDiscursive mechanisms in a white zone of proximal development\\n\\nThree primary discursive mechanisms functioned to maintain the discursive (and design) space as largely a\\nwhite zone of proximal development situated in a white institutional space. The first mechanism coincides with\\nMartin’s (2008) first element of white institutional space: racial exclusion. In this episode of interaction, turns of\\ntalk, topic changes, and decision making were dominated by white members of the project team. The second\\nmechanism is reflected in Martin’s assertion that much of mathematics education continues to be guided by\\ncurricular models created and sustained by white elites. In this episode, materials, activities, and ideas used to\\nbuild the PD, and the expertise that was assigned in the construction process, were often located within a white\\nzone of proximal development, which reifies the white institutional space. The third mechanism stemmed from a\\nconceptualization of “trust” and “readiness” related to white norms (and subsequent practices). These\\nconceptualizations emerged in relation to the topic of whiteness deemed “difficult” to discuss with teachers and\\nreflect power-evasive moves that maintained and sustained the white institutional space. We illustrate these\\nthree mechanisms below through brief abbreviated vignettes from each episode.\\nThe complex interplay between race and professional status was prevalent in how more capable peers\\nwere acknowledged in conversation. This was evident in two ways concerning how scholars of color were\\ninvited into discussions. First, scholars of color from the project were invited only when the conversation turned\\nto issues of race, despite their expertise in other areas, such as the design and implementation of PD. One white\\nprincipal investigator commented on the PD design saying, “I feel like there’s less of the focus on the self, and\\non whiteness and the history of whiteness in this community and the overlap between whiteness and\\nmathematics. Maybe it is too much to do in a week, but I think it would be good to get other people’s feedback\\non that. What do people think?” (May 2016 Transcript, Turn 165). Since the conversation was dominated by\\nwhite scholars up until this point, this discursive move to solicit the feedback of “people” and “other people”\\nwas coded language for wanting feedback from scholars of color. Second, when scholars of color were brought\\ninto the conversation, only those prominent in the field outside of the project were referenced as expects. A\\nwhite principal investigator (turn 275) requested more concrete and detailed suggestions for future changes to\\nthe PD design. “(275) If the thought is, we are really not getting at interrogating whiteness enough, then it would\\nalso be helpful to have some suggestions. Move this here or do this instead or make sure…” “(276) Or bring in\\n[outside consultant who is a person of color]. Because I don’t know the activities [they would do in their\\ninstitutes focused on anti-racism]” (May 2016 Transcript, Turns 275-276). After the request, another white\\nprincipal investigator (turn 276) quickly turned to the curricular materials and expertise from a scholar of color\\noutside of the research group. References to outside experts and focus on limitations of project members tended\\nto diminish the opportunity for the project team, especially the project members of color who brought varied\\nexpertise and experience to uncover and develop new sets of expertise.\\nAnother way whiteness emerged was in the dismissal of contributions of scholars of colors in favor of\\nwhite normative conceptualizations. For example, one African American researcher, a graduate student, offered\\na counter-narrative to the conceptualization of trust and its relation to risk-taking among teachers engaging in\\ntopics around equity and social justice advocated by the white researchers stating, “I feel like in the ways in\\nwhich we’re talking about these teachers in terms of not being ready for—I think it’s a little premature” (May\\n2016 Transcript, Turn 186). They highlighted participants’ identities as teachers who teach a particular racial\\ngroup of students (predominantly African American children), which suggested that teachers (white or\\notherwise) could be ready for race-based conversations based on the context of their work and their connection\\nto their students. This notion of being prepared for race-based conversation based on participants’ caring\\nrelationship to students was raised again by another scholar of color later in this conversation, but again was not\\ntaken up among other participants.\\nThe tensions we faced in attempting to transgress whiteness in the design of this PD are prevalent in\\nthe field of mathematics education research, particularly among white researchers who take a social justice\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n1143\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\norientation to their work. We argue that the discursive mechanisms taking place within and reifying white zones\\nof proximal development are ubiquitous in the current conditions of mathematics teacher PD, and require close\\nattention by mathematics teacher educators. As a result, we must critically examine the lines of research that\\ninform research goals and materials. As Aguirre et al. (2017) argue, it is important to find and draw on research\\nby scholars of color, and to expand our views on what counts as research that relates to mathematics education.\\nThe research of scholars from less-dominant backgrounds should not be “tokenized” as solely related to issues\\nof equity, but rather inform how we conceive of “knowledge” and the relations between mathematics,\\ncommunity and broader social issues. This calls for the application of more expansive understanding and\\nacknowledgement of expertise and meditational tools in the design and implementation of mathematical\\nlearning experiences. Furthermore, mathematics education researchers should look beyond the scope of our\\ndiscipline to fields in which ideas around race, racism, whiteness and white supremacy are more deeply\\ntheorized.\\n\\nRelevant scholarly references\\n\\nAguirre, J., Herbel-Eisenmann, B., Celedón-Pattichis, S., Civil, M., Wilkerson, T., Stephan, M., … Clements, D.\\nH.

       "'Community Engagement, Outreach, Informal Learning, Identity\\n\\nResearch problem\\n\\nThere is a considerable lack of similar role models for women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and\\nMathematics (STEM) as (white) men make up the majority of STEM faculty in universities in the United States\\n(National Science Foundation, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2013); and women are also\\nmore likely to leave STEM majors as compared to their male peers (Strenta, et al.,1994). Along racial lines,\\nrepresentation of women of color in STEM is further limited. According to the NSF (2013), White women\\ncomprised 20% of the STEM workforce, Black and Hispanic women made up 2% respectively, while Asian\\nwomen comprised 5% of the STEM workforce and 1% of women who self-selected “other category” comprised\\nthe US STEM workforce.\\nThis gender and racial disparity in STEM may signal to women they do not belong or cannot succeed in\\nthese fields (Walton & Cohen, 2007; Hermann et al., 2016). And because women entering STEM fields tend to\\nunderestimate their self-efficacy (Correll, 2001; Meece et al., 1982; Deaux & Emswiller, 1974), non-stereotypical\\nrole models, or historically underrepresented role models in STEM, have been thought to improve female\\nstudents’ sense of self-efficacy and success in fields of STEM. In fact, in a psychological study examining effects\\nof stereotypes, Cheryan et al. (2011) found differences in women\\'s’ sense of self-efficacy in STEM were mediated\\nby the perceived dissimilarity from stereotypical role models. In addition, female role models have been shown\\nto increase retention of women in STEM fields (Hermann et al., 2016); therefore, work on the effects of seeing\\none’s self as a STEM role model for women and minorities needs to be further explored.\\nStudies have also shown women and minorities in STEM are more likely to succeed in institutional\\nenvironments with social and academic support systems such as mentorship opportunities (MacPhee et al., 2013).\\nIn a study conducted by Griffith (2010) using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF)\\nand the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) fewer women and minority STEM students\\npersisted in their majors as compared to male and non-minority students, however differences in persistence also\\ncorrelated with differences in college preparation and educational experiences. Institutional characteristics and\\nopportunities for women of color in STEM to frequently engage their peers about course work, to be involved in\\nSTEM-related student organizations, and have access to participate in undergraduate research programs can\\npositively impact female and minority student retention in STEM (Espinosa, 2011).\\nFinally, outreach programs have been shown to play a crucial role in the engineering education of\\ngraduate and undergraduate student instructors by fostering communication skills, leadership skills, and selfconfidence among women who participate in delivering outreach (Pickering et al., 2004). Community outreach\\nand engagement thus provides a perfect place to explore how participation in STEM related programs in an\\ninstitution support undergraduate STEM education and professional identity development. By having\\nnondominant students discuss their experiences, educational researchers can better understand how outreach is\\ntaken up by those students and what effect participation in outreach has on students and their identification with\\nSTEM. The purpose of this paper will be to examine, through case study, how individuals underrepresented in\\nSTEM participated in outreach, leading to their own development as “non-stereotypical” role models in STEM.\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n120\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\nFurthermore, understanding how “non-stereotypical” role models develop can better aid in retention and\\nengagement of groups underrepresented in STEM.\\n\\nScholarly significance\\n\\nIn this study, I tracked 10 students’ academic trajectories and observed students interacting with their peers and\\nwith K-12 youth. Preliminary data analysis suggests students in this program are learning leadership skills, being\\nprovided with networking opportunities, building self-efficacy in their respective fields, and going on to become\\nprofessionals in STEM after graduation (Hinojosa, Torres, Callejas, & Speer, 2016). This paper describes how\\nserving as a role model in outreach contributes to professional identity formation in First Generation College\\nStudents (FGCS), a group underrepresented in STEM and higher education. Key components of the student\\nexperience appear to be: encountering and being mentored by role models (program leaders) and peers (more\\nexperienced students) from underrepresented groups in their field of study, and then assuming the position of\\nbeing a non-stereotypical role models themselves for youth of similar backgrounds. Understanding how nonstereotypical role models develop can better aid in engagement and retention of groups historically\\nunderrepresented in STEM by demonstrating to younger generations that scientists are as diverse as the people\\nwho populate this planet; thus, aiding to dispel negative stereotypes which may cause students to perform poorly\\nin school (Marx, Ko, & Friedman, 2009).\\nThe contribution of this study to the Learning Sciences community is to extend the theoretical framework\\nof identity formation as a result of being mentored and mentoring others. The authentic outreach community\\nworks as a model for learning and identity development using 2 layers of mentoring and role modeling. In the\\ncontext of the outreach program, NEO, the undergraduate instructors spend the fall semester preparing lessons\\nand activities for outreach into K-12 local classrooms and developing their understanding of content knowledge\\nin neuroscience topics. This is done with peers, the program leader, and guest faculty speakers doing current\\nresearch in neuroscience. In the following semester—in the Spring—undergraduate instructors go out to local\\ncommunities positioned as experts in neuroscience and as representatives of the university. Because program\\nrecruitment is focused on diversity, the majority of participants are women from underrepresented groups in\\nSTEM. This mean they are directly positioned not only as role models in neuroscience, but as non-stereotypical\\nrole models in that field. In this paper, I examine how this positioning of being a non-stereotypical role model\\ncontributes to identity development as a role model and as a professional in STEM.\\n\\nTheoretical framework\\n\\nThe distance measuring the individual’s actual identity to a future possible identity imagined by self and others is\\nrepresented by the Zone of Proximal Identity Development (ZOPID; Polman, 2006, p.246). Using the ZOPID—\\nsimilar to Vygotsky’s (1978) Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)—identity development is viewed as tied to\\nthe participant’s past positioning and positioning by self and others during social activities. Positioning within the\\noutreach program is structured within a mentorship model which has two main components of mentorship: (1)\\nmentoring from both faculty/staff; and (2) mentoring from more knowledgeable peers to newcomers in the\\nprogram. A third component also emerges when undergraduate instructors go out to the classrooms as they are\\nplaced in the position of role models to youth from similar backgrounds, thus modeling to youth that a scientist\\ncan appear as they do. Figure 1 (below) is a diagram of how undergraduate instructors move between the different\\nstages of the outreach program and how their positioning and identification changes in moments of time. The red\\nhighlights the portions of the outreach program where participant’s identity positionings are incrementally\\nscaffolded to become more knowledgeable peers to newcomers as well as experts in neuroscience to the local\\ncommunities. This contributes to the development of a professional STEM identity and a non-stereotypical role\\nmodel in STEM. By using the ZOPID, I seek to unpack how this development occurs over time for three NEO\\ninstructors who identify as Latina women and the first generation to attend college in their families.\\nNeuroscience Education Outreach (NEO) is an outreach program sponsored by a large public university\\nlocated in the mountain west region of the United States. The goal of NEO is to empower and engage K-12\\nstudents to take charge of their mental and physical health through neuroscience education. Lessons are designed\\nto teach children and adolescents about their brain through a series of fun activities around lessons which\\ndemonstrate how the brain works. Undergraduate students in STEM serve as the instructors who prepare the\\nlessons and activities, go into the surrounding schools and communities (in pairs or more), and facilitate the age\\nappropriate lessons and activities (see figure 1 for NEO program structure).\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n121\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\nFigure 1. The outreach model is structured to accommodate both newcomers into the program as well as more\\nseasoned peers I refer to as More Knowledgeable Peers (MKP). In the fall semester timepoint 1 (T 1 ) outreach\\ninstructors, who are recruited in a manner which is focused on diversity, prepared age appropriate lessons and\\nactivities to go out into the local classrooms. They are scaffolded by the program leader, who invites university\\nneuroscientists to discuss current research, as well as by the MKPs. In the Spring semester, or timepoint 2 (T 2 ),\\noutreach instructors positioned as the experts go into local classrooms and facilitate the lessons and activities.\\nBy doing so they become MKPs themselves and assist other undergraduates in planning future sessions in the\\nfollowing Fall semester, or timepoint 3 (T 3 ). I seek to explain identity development as the undergraduate\\nmentors move through this model in real time.\\n\\nMethods and data sources\\n\\nParticipants at the time of the study included 10 undergraduate instructors, however for the scope of this paper I\\nelaborate on 3 instructors (Sarah, Zena, and Abby), who identify as first-generation college students (FGCS).\\nSources of data include annual surveys and interviews as well as peer and classroom observations of interactions\\nconducted throughout 2 academic years: Fall 2015- Spring 2017.\\nAnalytic Approach: Trajectories of Identification. I use sociocultural theory (Wertsch, 1998) to\\nconceptualize learning environments as places where participants connect their past, present, and future selves,\\nand in this way, make sense of who they are which further leads to how they participate in those environments.\\nUsing the trajectories of identification framework (Polman & Miller, 2010) I theorize participation and identity\\nas dynamic and co-constructed via participation in social interactions and activities. To further analyze trajectories\\nof identification, I looked at the parameters of prolepsis, positioning, agency, and scene.\\nProlepsis occurs on the individual, cognitive level, and refers to how participants (and those they interact\\nwith) make sense of and act out connections between the participant’s past (prior lived experiences and memories),\\npresent, and their imagined future (Cole, 1996). This imagined future can be either imagined for the participant\\nby others and/or by the participant him-/herself. Prolepsis therefore can lead the participant toward, or deter away\\nfrom different types of imagined individual trajectories or pathways. The parameter includes “proleptic\\nreferences” to the participants’ past (or similar types of people); to possible futures (for self and others similar);\\nand finally, analyzes how present-day activities and interactions connect to either past or future selves. These\\nproleptic references include stories which refer to role models and mentors, as well as imagined stories of\\nthemselves and others. Prolepsis can therefore be seen in the narratives participants tell about themselves and/or\\nothers, as well as seen in the actions and interactions of the individual participants during social activities.\\nProlepsis can also lead to positioning as identity is dialogically negotiated, and the enactment of envisioned\\nidentities and trajectories (both by self and others) shapes directly how that individual participates in that\\ncommunity. In the analysis, I distinguish between how one positions self and others, as well as how they are\\npositioned by others within the outreach community. The individual can then either resist or accept forms of\\npositioning which can be seen in social interactions and actions. How the individual reacts to positioning constitute\\nforms of resistance to, or acceptance of certain trajectories of identification.\\nPositioning also refers to identifications from society and community. Society and community position\\nindividuals, either explicitly or implicitly, within that society before that individual begins to act in society. Even\\nbefore one is born, there is an imagined future by parents (prolepsis) and one is positioned by culture and society\\n(e.g., \"girls\\' clothes, toys, colors, etc.) to be something imagined for that person (Turner & Reynolds, 2010).\\nTherefore, prolepsis and positioning are also shaped by societal factors and influences which further shape\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n122\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\ntrajectories of identification. These influences at the societal level may refer to identifications such as stereotypes\\n(which are often negative, promoting a deficit view based on race, gender, etc.), or may refer to lack of\\nrepresentation or role models, and are recognized by individuals as they participate in social activities and\\ninteractions (Peteet et al., 2015; Steele, 1997; Clance & Imes, 1978). Therefore, identity is constantly being\\nnegotiated and renegotiated during interactions with others; and with how the individual is positioned by self,\\nothers, and also society. Agency refers to the capacity of an individual to act independently and be an agent in\\ntheir own decision making (and thus identification and participation). In demonstrating competence in\\nneuroscience content and outreach responsibilities, undergraduate instructors begin to position themselves as\\nagents in their own trajectories of identification.\\nLastly, learning environments are both structured and constrained by community and institutional goals\\nand ways of positioning, referred to as scene. The STEM environment is not a-cultural, but instead STEM\\npractices are embedded in deep cultural contexts which may be taken for granted as “norms” by insiders; and this\\nis further embedded in a university environment. The community and institutional environment (and embedded\\nnorms) are referred to as the scene or place. Analyzing scene included looking at how particularly types of people\\nand practices are taken up or not by the university outreach program. In conclusion, prolepsis, positioning, agency,\\nand scene interact to form trajectories of identification for the individual leading to identity development.\\nBecause identity is constantly evolving in time and is situated in context, I used narrative analysis to\\nexamine expressions of identity (de Fina, 2015) in multiple interviews trajectory of identifications framework. I\\nexamined interviews and field notes of interactions with public and peers to look for positioning cues and proleptic\\nreferences. Salient social categories began to emerge. One particular category, first generation college student\\n(FGCS), encompassed other traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM and presented elements of social\\ninfluences (i.e., lack of role models or college preparation) contributing to that identification. Using the ZOPID\\n(Polman, 2010) and trajectories of identification framework (Polman & Miller, 2010), I analyzed trajectories of\\nidentification in the development of non-stereotypical role models for three FGCS instructors as they progressed\\nin their role in outreach and in their college career.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nWomen and other minoritized groups are lumped together when NSF and other institutions discuss\\nunderrepresentation in STEM disciplines and submit proposals to aid in bolstering that representation, yet the\\nterm “underrepresented” is never explicitly clarified other than its inclusivity of women (including white women)\\nand minorities (people of color). Through analysis of interview data and examining the role the category of FGCS\\nplays, one can see members of FGCS tend to also share other categories which are considered underrepresented\\nin science and engineering. For instance, Sarah, Zena, and Amber in this study share the categories of FGCS and\\nLatina and have similar tensions and experiences when adapting to the college environment. In addition, these\\nwomen of color find encountering and becoming role models exciting and inspiring for their own persistence in\\nSTEM. In fact, atypical of the current demographics of the university and its STEM programs, the majority of the\\ninstructors in NEO are women and/or minorities in the STEM field.\\nThis type of environment is referenced by Amber as providing guidance and mentorship in academia, as\\nwell as providing a community of women in science with similar goals of outreach (i.e., a social and academic\\nsupport system). In the case of Sarah, outreach to those with “similar backgrounds” is especially appealing as she\\nbegins to take on the identity of role model. Lastly, while the majority of the instructors are women from\\nnondominant communities, there is also a mix of men and women from dominant communities.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nExamining FGCS more closely from the point of view of FGCSs, one can see the main associative factor is lacking\\nknowledge of the college experience, lacking role models, lacking economic resources, and being a minority\\n(and/or woman) student in STEM, which resonated in the narratives of Amber, Zena, and Sarah (Hinojosa, 2018).\\nA first-generation college student is a student whose parents have not obtained a degree from a higher learning\\ninstitution. This implies a lack of family resources or role models when students go into college. In all excerpts\\nSarah, Amber, and the program leader make connections to social factors which further contribute to attrition\\nfrom STEM: being female, being from a lower SES background, being Latina, being a first-generation college\\nstudent, as well as lacking role models in STEM. Sociohistorical factors influence the present-day scene in higher\\neducation and these factors contribute further to the academic achievement gap and STEM underrepresentation\\n(Spring, 2016; Solomon, 1985). While this does not disprove any profound finding previously about\\nunderrepresentation in STEM, it does provide evidence outreach and community engagement is an effective\\nmedium to create more non-stereotypical role models of students who are underrepresented in science.\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n123\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\nThe NEO program structures itself as a mentorship model, and has two main components of mentorship:\\n(1) mentoring from both faculty/staff; and (2) mentoring from more knowledgeable peers to newcomers in the\\nprogram. A third component also emerges when undergraduate instructors go out to the classrooms as they are\\nplaced in the position of role models to youth from similar backgrounds, thus modeling to youth that a scientist\\ncan look like they do. Brooke (all proper names are pseudonyms) is the director of the outreach program, and is\\nfrequently referred to by the instructors as being a role model, resource and mentor. While NEO’s goal is to\\ndisseminate neuroscience information to the public, the instructors are receiving a level of role modeling and\\nguidance which ultimately contributes to their persistence in STEM. Preparing instructors to teach lessons and\\nfacilitate activities is akin to an apprenticeship model whereby a novice is introduced to the content knowledge,\\nand scaffolded on how to manage classroom interactions and activities by more knowledgeable peers (experienced\\ninstructors) (Rogoff, 1995) to practice science communication and public speaking skills. Lastly, Brooke positions\\nthe instructors as expected to succeed in their college careers, and as young scientists and role models.\\n\\nCase Study 1:\\n\\nSarah is a double major in biology and philosophy in her third year at the university (after much uncertainty and\\nswitching majors), and currently works in a neuroscience and psychology lab on campus studying the effects of\\nphysical activity on the brain. She regrets not starting out in neuroscience, and attributes her decision to lack of\\nknowledge about neuroscience before starting college. She is interested in pursuing a career in medicine yet has\\nexpressed uncertainty in her future career plans. Below she discusses neuroplasticity to high school female\\nstudents and how first-generation students may struggle more in college compared to the traditional student (due\\nto “inequalities”, perhaps referring to low SES or lack of knowledge/college preparation). She remarks how this\\nwas frustrating at first, but the brain can learn and adapt.\\n[Excerpt 1]:…I kinda spoke about my experience as a first generation college student how\\nacademia is—especially at the higher levels—is really challenging…[a]nd how often times you\\njust wanna kinda say like…“Oh my gosh, I’m so dumb”, or “I’m so behind” but neuroplasticity\\nkinda gives you evidence to suggest that you can improve inequalities that you’re not happy\\nabout... like studying habits and stuff and… neuroplasticity…helps you become better at\\nsomething that you wanna do (Sarah, Interview, August 2016).\\nThe above excerpt is from an interview with Sarah about her teaching experience in a college prep group\\nfor high school girls from low socioeconomic background, primarily from the local Latino communities—these\\nstudents are on the college track and would be the first in their families to attend. Prolepsis was apparent when\\nSarah expressed her feeling “connected” to the students instantly because she holds membership in a social\\ncategory the students are likely to share in their near future. Sarah also stated she was from a “similar background”\\nand later stated she felt this connection due to the shared category of being Latina and low SES, as well as being\\na FGCS. Sarah noted that she saw herself as a role model to students (who reminded her of herself in high school)\\nthat day and even exchanged emails with one student interested in neuroscience. This went beyond the\\nrequirements of outreach as Sarah took a more personal interest in the imagined trajectories of the students with\\nwhom she interacted.\\n\\nCase Study 2:\\n\\nAmber graduated from the university with a degree in Biology in December 2016. Amber positioned herself as a\\nFGCS during her college career. After she graduated she took a job as an analytical chemist in order to gain lab\\nexperience and go into the health field. Her desired career and projected identity is a diabetes researcher. She saw\\nBrooke and other female professors as role models and found a supportive environment of peers in her outreach\\ncommunity.\\n[Excerpt 2]: [I]n my opinion…we really down-sell the mentorship part of this program because\\nthere\\'s a huge, through [Brooke], through the other students, there\\'s a huge mentorship\\npart…(Amber, Interview, May, 2016).\\nThis was in stark contrast to the university scene for Amber, as she lacked a sense of belonging at first, which she\\nattributed to her dissimilarity from the average university student. Amber remarked that she could not quit school,\\ndespite typical FGCS challenges, because she wanted to be a role model to others, especially to young girls\\ninterested in science. As noted in the next case, Zena shared similar sentiments.\\n\\nCase Study 3:\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n124\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\nZena was a psychology major (after much uncertainty and switching majors) in her fifth year at university, and\\nwanted to pursue a career in education. She attributed her motivation to teach as tied directly to her participation\\nin NEO. During outreach, she was positioned as a neuroscientist by the NEO director and by classroom teachers\\nand students. Zena also used her social categories of FGCS and Mexican to connect to communities with people\\nsharing a similar background. In this way, Zena was positioned as a non-stereotypical role model in the Latino\\ncommunities she interacted with.\\nIn Spring 2017, Zena organized events for the Latino community to involve parents to discuss\\neducational neuroscience and how that related to childcare. Many of the parents and community members\\npositioned Zena as a role model for their children, and were very interested in hearing the story of a FGCS\\nsucceeding. Parents began to see their own kids’ possible futures as being similar to Zena’s. Zena felt she could\\ngive the Latina mothers advice based on her own hardships and adversities as a FCGS, and in this way, was\\npositioned by her community and herself as a role model of a successful university student. “Telling [the\\ncommunity] what I do I feel… gives them a broader sense of what they can do” (Zena, Interview, April 2017).\\nZena continued to express a sentiment Amber expressed in her 2016 interview:\\nSo like I mentioned before, letting other people down...‘Cause you know I want to be an\\ninspiration to someone... to at least one person and so being able to say, “yeah, I came here and\\nit was hard and difficult, but I did it and look at where I am now” kind of thing. I want to be\\nable to say that and the kids that we go and teach are like: “wow, you go to university, you go\\nthere! How did you make it that way?” And so if I didn’t, if I decided no, maybe I’ll go here\\ninstead cause it just feels safer or closer to whatever then I would feel like I kind of gave up on\\nsomething and I was not what I thought I was (Zena, Interview, April 2017).\\nIn the above excerpt Zena’s identity of being a successful first-generation college student is linked to her success\\nat the university she attends, which is known for its excellence in STEM. By doing service work as a student\\nrepresentative of a major university, which lacks in diversity and in her experience, has had professors discourage\\nher from pursuing her degree, Zena is combating those institutional and societal identifications and positionings\\nimposed upon her in the university setting. She resists this scene by being a role model to others who might face\\nsimilar challenges in pursuit of a higher degree at a major STEM university. Zena thus gains inspiration from\\noutreach, as she inspires youth she interacts with, to continue her degree in this particular university: “...the kids\\nI teach have been really inspiring to me ‘cause...I wanna work hard and fight [for them] (Zena, Interview, April\\n2017).” Themes of connecting to youth from similar backgrounds, seeing one’s self as a role model to youth and\\nsimultaneously building confidence and inspiration to continue in school are shared among Zena, Amber, and\\nSarah.\\nThis bias of having lower expectation for poor students (and students of color) speaks to a larger deficit\\ndiscourse of teachers, administrators, and policy makers (Benner & Mistry, 2007; Diamond et al., 2004; Cooper\\net al., 1982). In the U.S., where K-12 teachers are predominantly white and from middle class backgrounds, this\\ncan be devastating as classrooms are becoming increasingly diverse (Steele, 2001;2008). Furthermore, this\\nassumption resonates with teachers from nondominant backgrounds as in the case of Zena. Zena sees this as\\nimportant to her projected future trajectory as a K-12 teacher:\\nI guess, the assumption that like lower income kids don’t know as much...those were definitely\\nchallenged. I was like “oh my gosh, why have I been thinking this?” They definitely know as much and\\nthey are definitely interested and want to learn this stuff and...that was helpful and it really challenged\\nme and totally changed my mind and now I’m like “oh my gosh, I cannot be thinking this way if I’m\\ngoing to be a teacher” (Zena Interview, April 2017).\\nZena specifically points out her challenged assumptions of low income students not knowing as much as students\\nfrom more affluent groups (i.e., lower expectations of the knowledge lower income students bring to the\\nclassroom). This was a shock to Zena as she herself is from a lower income background, wants to work with those\\nyouth, and is on track to become an educator. These biases and assumptions are deeply embedded and can remain\\nunconscious; only when those biases are challenged by our immediate interactions with those we don’t normally\\ninteract with do the biases come to the surface. The outreach instructors in NEO, including Zena, spent time after\\neach lesson writing their reflections after performing outreach for both program feedback as well as for their own\\npersonal learning and growth. The reflexivity afforded by this practice may have contributed to her asserting\\nagency in social awareness to overcome personal bias.\\n\\nDiscussion of major findings\\n\\nICLS 2018 Proceedings\\n\\n125\\n\\n© ISLS\\n\\nBy examining identity formation through moments in time within an authentic outreach model using the\\ntheoretical framework of the ZOPID, the practices associated with STEM retention and student achievement in\\ntheir STEM degrees can be seen as encountering and becoming non-stereotypical role models. In the cases of\\nSarah, Zena, and Amber, these Latina women share the category of FGCS and have similar tensions and\\nexperiences when adapting to the college environment, or the university scene. The motivation behind doing\\noutreach for all three participants was to empower communities with less access to pertinent neuroscience\\ninformation to effect change in their own lives, and to inspire others to do science by being roles models to youth\\nlike themselves. Evidence shows the outreach instructors both found role models in their field (in the program\\nsupervisor and more knowledgeable peers), as well as saw themselves as role models during interactions with K12 students. Thus, prolepsis may occur in the K-12 youth’s mind as they see themselves in the outreach instructors,\\nleading to the development of trajectories of identifications involving science in the future for the youth. Hence,\\nthe distance between their imagined identity and their actual identity (the ZOPID) diminished. During outreach\\nparticipation, the three instructors were positioned by themselves and others as scientists and role models for\\nyouth from nondominant communities interested in exploring or pursuing a science career. Some instructors\\nexplored other challenges in participating in outreach in nondominant communities, and upon further examination,\\na larger negative stereotyping discourse of low income, non-white communities can be seen in the educational\\nscene. Zena mentioned this tension even though her own background is low income, non-white, and first\\ngeneration to go to college. As noted elsewhere, unconscious biases related to students\\' membership in minoritized\\ngroups can be harmful for students as teacher expectations affect student outcomes (Benner & Mistry, 2007;\\nDiamond et. al, 2004; Cooper et al., 1982). Using reflexivity, Zena began to draw connections from her\\nassumptions and actual interactions with youth from nondominant communities, thus allowing her more agency\\nin her conceptions of low income youth. This allows her to see youth in new imagined trajectories, leading to a\\ndifferent positioning of the youth which links their pasts to present and ultimately to imagined futures of being a\\nsuccessful college student in STEM. This provides room for a rippling effect of role models begetting future role\\nmodels.\\n\\nConclusion and further implications\\n\\nThis study provides evidence of how mentorship models within university outreach can be an effective site for\\nthe development of non-stereotypical role models in science. In order for Amber, Zena, and Sarah to continue\\nwith their college careers they all had to overcome the scene of the university environment and how those in the\\nenvironment positioned them differently than how they were positioned during outreach. For example, professors\\nintimidated the FGCSs during classes often remarking “you should already know this,” referring to domain\\ncontent knowledge, leaving Zena and others to equate their lack of college preparedness to lack of intelligence.\\nDuring outreach, instructors found a group of similar and supportive peers, as well as found female role models\\nin science who positioned them also as such. The three FGCS instructors have since learned how to talk to faculty\\nmembers (networking) and how to navigate STEM institutions contributing to their engagement and retention in\\nSTEM. Zena and Amber attribute their networking skills to having a strong social network of peers, mentors and\\nnon-stereotypical role models. This impact, i.e., empowering youth to effect change in their lives, is something\\nall instructors pointed to as their personal motivation to perform outreach work. This study thus demonstrates\\npersonal growth and professional identity development during participation in community outreach. Future\\nimplications involve bringing this model and framework to university settings to foster student success and bolster\\ndiversity in STEM higher education and ultimately into STEM professional fields.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBenner, A.

      "\n",
      "In this manuscript we examine the stories of youth makers from non-dominant communities, and argue that\n",
      "through their making practice they are involved not only in “artifact making” (the prototypically viewed\n",
      "outcome of makerspace work), but also in space-making within and across the worlds of STEM, makerspaces,\n",
      "and community. Such space-making fosters new forms of interaction among scales of activity, and supports the\n",
      "movement of ideas, resources, relationships and bodies in support of youths’ emerging practices and how they\n",
      "might be recognized for them. As the youth engage in their making practice, they inscribe new meanings for\n",
      "what it means to make within the worlds they inhabit, refiguring participation in these worlds and the\n",
      "possibilities for becoming within them.\n",
      "Our research questions are thus: 1) What making practice do youth from non-dominant communities,\n",
      "ages 11-14, take up in a afterschool community-based makerspace? 2) In what ways does their practice inscribe\n",
      "their spaces of making with possibilities for doing and becoming in making for community sustainability?\n",
      "To answer these questions, we present two in-depth narratives of youths’ engagement in a communitybased makerspace. The first case involves Samuel’s efforts to build the light-up football when he was in the 6th\n",
      "grade. The second case involves Jennifer and Emily’s efforts to prototype a heated, light-up sweatshirt in the 7th\n",
      "grade. While our telling of these narratives revolve directly around the youths’ making of artifacts, we hope to\n",
      "show how their practices for doing so alter the landscapes in which they work, and their opportunities to do and\n",
      "become within and across those spaces.\n",
      "Findings indicate that the youth in our study have engaged in making practices that led to the creation\n",
      "of new artifacts that mattered to people in their communities. Further, youths’ making practices were\n",
      "undergirded in what we think of as “mobilities of criticality,” as they remixed and repurposed tools, practices\n",
      "and relationships from various communities towards space-making. In particular, we show how the youths’\n",
      "making practices are rooted in community, and are reflections of their deep and critical knowledge of the needs\n",
      "their communities face within and across the spaces of making. We also discuss how the youth’s in-themoment actions – a reflection of their making practices – served as critical “pivot points” in their design work\n",
      "(Holland, Lachiotte, Skinner, & Cain, 2001). The pivot points connected scales of activity, including STEM\n",
      "inquiry, making, community and action taking, in how they provided analytical foci for driving technically\n",
      "oriented design work, and opportunities for social negotiation towards new possibilities of doing and becoming\n",

      "\n",
      "We are interested in questions of youth engagement and identity work in making as it relates to how the spaces\n",
      "and places of making get re-organized, disrupted, and/or expanded through the youths’ making practices. In\n",
      "particular, we are concerned with how youth’s making practices take shape across multiple scales of activity\n",
      "simultaneously, but also over time – e.g., locally among peers in small group work in makerspaces as well as in\n",
      "the real and imagined spaces of STEM. Thus, we draw from mobilities of learning studies and social practice\n",
      "theory to frame our concerns. We are particularly interested in those studies that take a critical orientation,\n",
      "weaving in issues of power and positioning.\n",
      "A mobilities of learning framework is centrally concerned with movement – of people, ideas, tools,\n",
      "resources, bodies and relationships – and how such movement shapes and reshapes the spaces and places of\n",
      "learning, and the social practices enacted and made possible therein (Leander et al, 2010). As individuals move\n",
      "through space and time, the sociohistorical narratives around them shift, shaping and reshaping how they inhabit\n",
      "or reinhabit space (Gutiérrez, 2012). For example, Kwan (2008) describes how Muslim American women’s\n",
      "movements within public spaces have become restricted in the US since 9/11 in response to rising political\n",
      "narratives even though the actual physical access to these spaces remain unchanged. At the same time, she\n",
      "illustrates how such limitations in physical movement sit in juxtaposition with increasing access to new digital\n",
      "spaces. These arising digital spaces have become new homes for exposing oppressive narratives experienced by\n",
      "the women, as well as for opening up new opportunities for relationship building practices across cultural\n",
      "difference.\n",
      "Examining the critical literacy practices of migrant youth in Southern California, Gutiérrez (2008)\n",
      "describes how youth use their “complete linguistic toolkit” – toolkits made up of linguistic practices of home\n",
      "and community, such as testimonio, in addition to the practices that are sanctioned in school settings – to\n",
      "navigate “the paradoxes of migration, immigration, and schooling” in the US. (p. 150). These hybrid practices\n",
      "helped students to link their past and present to an imagined future, and to reorganize everyday concepts\n",
      "acquired through social interaction in joint activities of school-based literacies. She suggests that these “rich\n",
      "interactional matrices of practice” lead to a new dialectic between the “the world as it is and the world as it\n",
      "could be” opening up new spaces for learning and transformation (p. 160).\n",
      "In both of these studies, who individuals are and who they can be across the spaces –temporal,\n",
      "physical, and virtual – of their lives, and the practices they take up within and across those spaces, emerge from\n",
      "and transform the meanings of those space as constructed through social activity.\n",
      "Mobilities of learning studies remind us that learning always takes place somewhere, both in “relation\n",
      "to history (time) and context (place/space)” (Bright, Manchester, Allendyke, 2013, p. 749). One thread of work\n",
      "that is particularly salient to our own work is that which examines space-making as a part of more expansive\n",
      "views of learning. We use the term space-making in ways similar to that of place-making (e.g., Cresswell, 1996,\n",
      "2004; Massey, 2005; Lombard, 2014). An individual’s opportunities to be and to become are shaped by place.\n",
      "At the same time, who one is also gives meaning to place; “places do no have intrinsic meanings and essences . .\n",
      ". the meanings of place are created through practice” (Creswell, 1996, p. 17).\n",
      "However, by drawing attention to spaces over places, we acknowledge the itinerant over the fixed\n",
      "nature of learning, where space reflects “a territory defined by practice-based learning, inhabited by a network\n",
      "of people, ideas, and objects in movement” rather than a fixed geographical area (Fendler, 2014, p. 787). We\n",
      "also use “space” to suggest that the possible platforms for being and becoming are not only solely contingent on\n",
      "the structural landscape of geographical places but are also tied to norms and power structures. “Space” also\n",
      "connotes for us the plurality of spaces (platforms for being and becoming) that are connected to a singular\n",
      "geographical place, e.g. youths’ residential neighborhood.\n",
      "Gutiérrez (2012) work on expansive learning helps to unpack the importance of movement across both\n",
      "vertical and horizontal dimensions of learning. Here, movement refers to the ways in which ideas, tools and\n",
      "practices are re-authored and re-mixed towards new possibilities for becoming in-practice across setting and\n",
      "over time (Engeström & Sannino, 2010). Through learning activity, new activity structures are produced as\n",
      "vertical and horizontal dimensions interact, leading to new forms of activity. Gutiérrez describes these new\n",
      "forms of activity as the kinds of hybridity that emerge as the tensions and contradictions that arise within and\n",
      "between activity systems. In these studies, hybridity refers to the novel combinations of different repertoires of\n",
      "knowledge and practice (e.g., science and peer/family/community) as individuals who horizontally move ideas\n",
      "and practices. However, it also refers to the hybridity that exists at multiple levels of the learning environment,\n",
      "where many activity systems come together (e.g., science, student, teacher, schooling, etc.). This perspective,\n",
      "thus, allows us to better understand youths’ horizontal movement and hybridization toward making/engineering\n",
      "designs that are both meaningful from a disciplinary perspective and compelling to youth committed to their\n",

      "Our study was carried out as a critical ethnography over a two-year period. Critical ethnography was selected as\n",

      "social justice. Critical ethnography is grounded in the idea that researchers can use the tools of ethnography to\n",
      "conduct empirical research in an unjust world in ways that examine and transform inequalities from multiple\n",
      "perspectives (Trueba, 1999). Critical ethnography provided an approach in which to “politicize” the interaction\n",
      "between actors and the social structures through which they act, grounded in the belief that these relationships\n",
      "are never neutral. This approach was important as we attempted to make sense of how youth, who are\n",

      "Data analysis involved multiple stages and levels of coding based on procedures for open coding and method of\n",

      "transcripts (conducted yearly at mid year and end of year) as well as our fieldnotes and the students’ sketch-up\n",
      "notebooks kept during the course of their participation. The goal of this initial read through was to surface\n",
      "points and open codes of a) tensions and connections among the various youths’ forms of engagement in\n",

      "Samuel, why did you decide to make a light-up football?\n",
      "Well, when little kids are playing outside football and it's getting too dark\n",
      "and they still keep playing and somebody might get hit in the head or\n",

      "Samuel joined “M4C” a makerspace club at his local Boys and Girls Club during the fall of his 6th grade year.\n",
      "While he did not have friends in this club when he joined, and had never heard of “engineering” before, he said\n",
      "he wanted to join because he “kept seeing” what other kids were doing, and he wanted a chance to do\n",
      "“something like that” too. Samuel lived alone with his grandmother, after his mother ran into social and legal\n",
      "programs, a point that plays into his design work as we will see later.\n",
      "Samuel designed a prototype of a “light up football” while working in the makerspace over a period of\n",
      "five months. His light up football has LED tube lights that wrap around the ball to provide maximum lighting\n",
      "with minimal added weight, friction, or power expenditures. Because the lighting it so efficient, it would also\n",
      "keep hands from getting burnt. The lights are powered with rechargeable batteries that can be recharged at a\n",

      "the head. The batteries are stored in a pocket at the center of the ball, accessible by a small door, to keep it\n",
      "weighted properly and to minimize their potential contact with rain water and sweat.\n",
      "The idea for a light up football grew out of Samuel’s desire to make something that would be helpful to\n",
      "people in his community. As he states:\n",
      "[My football] say about me that I really care about people. And I could, like, do stuff in the\n",
      "community so it could, like, do stuff together, like, peers can do stuff together, like, neighbors\n",
      "or school neighbors could like, go outside and do stuff together. . . Cause, like, some kids\n",
      "don't really play football, don't have no friends and stuff, so I go find people to help out a\n",
      "little bit.\n",
      "Samuel’s idea of care is nested in an understanding of the special needs of the young people in his\n",
      "community. Samuel knew that lighting was a concern at night due to limited working streetlights in his\n",
      "neighborhood. He also felt that the game of football was a positive peer activity that helped young people his\n",
      "age make friends and stay out of trouble. He knew that most families could not afford an expensive toy, and that\n",
      "inefficient designs were costly to the environmental as well.\n",
      "Samuel worked tirelessly on his design for five months seeking help from family, friends, and\n",
      "engineering and football experts alike. He was proud of his efforts. As he stated, “I was really proud ‘cause it\n",
      "just made me feel good about myself so I could, like, acknowledge people what I could do. . . Like make what I\n",
      "did, a light-up football. I wanna make more stuff like that.”\n",
      "A light up football presented Samuel with many design problems of both technical and social\n",
      "consequence as well. For example, lighting a football requires power. As Samuel noted, powering the lights\n",
      "costs money. His initial solution was to use rechargeable batteries because “mine’s is rechargeable batteries so\n",
      "we can see all the time but so you won't have to keep going back to the store and buying, like, batteries to\n",
      "reuse.” Saving both money and time by not having to return to the store to buy new batteries were both\n",
      "important in order for Samuel to keep the lights powered.\n",
      "But, rechargeable batteries also addressed another design concern: environmental sustainability.\n",
      "Samuel was worried in particular about the problems created when non-rechargeable batteries are thrown into\n",
      "the trash. As he states, “Rechargeable batteries save energy and money so you won't have to, like, keep buying\n",
      "and buying batteries, so. [They] make the world greener. When you throw batteries away, those critters can get\n",
      "inside your trash, like the racoons, can like, take your batteries, take your trash and batteries out.”\n",
      "Powering the lights was, in fact, the “biggest design challenge” Samuel stated he faced. He noted that\n",
      "two batteries did not light the ball well enough, but more than two batteries, he felt, made the football too heavy,\n",
      "and too expensive. This insight seemed to spur Samuel to expand his design concerns to also include the weight\n",
      "of the football, and the location of the weight. Having his football like a “regular football” in terms of size,\n",
      "shape and weight, were all important, but all impacted by his desire to have a light up football.\n",
      "Samuel sought input on these concerns from local football experts, which included a local football star.\n",
      "When recounting how these different experts helped him in his design, Samuel noted that the football star\n",
      "helped him to think about how to make the ball balanced, so that it would not be too heavy on one side or the\n",
      "other. To solve this problem, Samuel had to cut deeply into his prototype to place the batteries in the far center.\n",
      "As he stated, “Yeah. Yeah so I used that and so when I went back and tried to do it, I made sure that when I cut\n",
      "it, I made sure that it could be deep enough so it won't, like, make it so heavy. So it could be, not be so light, it\n",
      "could be just right. So like a real NFL football.”\n",
      "There were many other design challenges that Samuel confronted as he progressed in his project. He\n",
      "sought out many different kinds of experts to help him out, from his mother to his peers, to football experts, to\n",
      "engineers, to the internet. All of these perspectives representing different kinds of expertise and needs mattered\n",

      "communities face risks that result from geographical, socioeconomic, and political challenges. However, the\n",
      "risks are greater for young people growing up in lower-income communities of color, where environmental and\n",

      "We see such criticality enacted by these youth in their making work as tied to four domains in\n",
      "particular: Economic (e.g. making their designs affordable), environmental (e.g., designs that reduce their\n",
      "communities carbon footprint and support local ecologies), social (e.g., fostering positive peer relationships,\n",
      "healthy well-being, community ownership, and preventing bullying and gang activity), and urban infrastructure\n",
      "(e.g., providing lighting and warmth on cold, dark days).\n",
      "For example, Samuel worried about dangerous peer friendships, such as gangs, and believed some of\n",
      "these peer-related challenges might be remedied with positive play, such as with football. Samuel persisted in\n",
      "refining his football so that it met the needs of a wide range of peers. He first sought peer input on lighting –\n",
      "weight and design. He then pushed for input on weighting and feel. He tested his football with peers his age and\n",
      "peers younger than him. He pressed them for feedback on what functionality they needed, which is why he\n",
      "ultimately sought to make sure his ball was waterproof. Each interaction required Samuel to consider many new\n",

      "Pivot Points and their functions\n",
      "As youth engage in such rooted making practices over time, their in-the-moment actions served as critical “pivot\n",
      "points” in their design work. The pivot points connected scales of activity, including STEM inquiry, making,\n",
      "community and action taking, in how they provided analytical foci for driving technically oriented design work,\n",

      "“mediating or symbolic devices” not just to “organize responses but also to pivot or shift into the frame of a\n",
      "different world”. When youth leveraged their funds of knowledge, for example, towards work on their projects,\n",
      "they etched their insideness onto their engineering design, in ways that impacted the design process and\n",
      "how/where it unfolds, as well as their role in it. As pivots, these funds were not simply complementary to the\n",
      "youths’ engineering design, but essential to both who they are and their design work. Pivot points include tools\n",
      "(e.g. sewing machine, Google Sketch Up), relationships (e.g. Samuel’s ties to his cousins and peers) and the\n",

      "challenges might be worth spending time on. In both cases presented in this manuscript, the youth leveraged\n",
      "their funds as navigational indicators to author a productive project launching space.\n",
      "Samuel drew from a wide range of funds – M4C youth makerspace, family, peer, and residential\n",
      "community funds – in order to locate a productive project launching space. As Samuel noted in his interview,\n",
      "his light-up football was an idea he “thought, and thought and thought about” while home at his grandmother’s\n",

      "limited streetlights, personal safety, and friendships – made that much more salient by his move to his\n",
      "grandmother’s care became points of negotiation for how and with whom he would work. Samuel switched\n",
      "group memberships twice, before he felt he had the space to tackle the issue he really cared about. Samuel’s\n",
      "initial ideas were legitimized by his cousins and peers who also knew that he had extensive experience playing\n",
      "football with friends, and had the expertise to design a football.\n",
      "2) Driving technically-oriented design solutions in dialog with community interests. We also see\n",
      "imprints of youth’s rootedness in how they worked across scales of activity in their systematic efforts to refine\n",
      "their design constraints and evaluate possible solutions towards optimization. New design cycles were initiated\n",
      "on both technical and community terms. For example, youth-set end-point assessments required them to seek\n",
      "multiple perspectives, both community-oriented and technical. As community funds initiated more complex\n",
      "design conditions, Samuel needed to deepen his knowledge of energy systems and environmental and economic\n",
      "impact. Working with a mentor, Samuel figured out how to calculate power requirements of different lighting\n",
      "systems. He read information on the Internet on the affordances of LED lights, when his friends told him that\n",
      "bulky lights would not work on the football. He spent time figuring out how to assembles the components in a\n",
      "circuit with a switch. When he became concerned about the affordability of batteries as well as the impact on\n",
      "battery disposal on the local ecology, he thought about rechargeable batteries. But even then he had to figure out\n",
      "how to charge the rechargeable batteries in environmental friendly ways.\n",
      "As Samuel began working on his design, he brought to bear a set of fairly specific community\n",
      "concerns, as discussed, to a fairly vague technical challenge. However, these specific community concerns\n",
      "helped Samuel to functionally break down the work he needed to accomplish from a technical standpoint – e.g.,\n",
      "work on the lighting, the weight, and the shape of the football. Samuel’s funds of knowledge also gave him\n",
      "starting points for where, within his social network, he might look for feedback.\n",

      "they can return to their community – not leave it as they move on up – speaks to this point well. In short, new\n",
      "possibilities in space-making operate both at the level of the making process, and the potential resultant impact\n",
      "of the youth-created innovation.\n",
      "The playing field in makerspaces (one area of space-making) literally and figuratively transformed for\n",
      "the youth as they incrementally, but systematically, refined the problem and design they were working on in\n",
      "both technical and social ways, expanding their connectedness to others, and thus the access they had to ideas,\n",
      "tools, and resources for advancing their developing expertise. As Samuel walked through the main club rooms\n",
      "with his ball, kids gathered around him asking to test it out, and where and when they could buy one. His picture\n",
      "with the pro football star hangs on the wall, and other youth have since joined M4C to “do what Samuel did”,\n",
      "which included “making” things and “meeting famous people.” Becoming an expert involved a form of vertical\n",
      "development in his deepening scientific knowledge and practice, but it also involved interative movement and\n",
      "engagement of such developing expertise with his cultural repertoires of practice (Gutiérrez, 2012).\n",
      "What is more, the youth’s designs helped to transform the playing field in community (another area of\n",
